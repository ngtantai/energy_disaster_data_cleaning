Washington,\\nDC: NTSB, 2000.\\n\\nAbstract: About 10:50 a.m. on December 11, 1998, while attempting to install a utility pole support anchor\\nin a city sidewalk in St. Cloud, Minnesota, a communications network installation crew struck and ruptured\\nan underground, 1-inch-diameter, high-pressure plastic gas service pipeline, thereby precipitating a natural\\ngas  leak.  About  39  minutes  later,  while  utility  workers  and  emergency  response  personnel  were  taking\\npreliminary  precautions  and  assessing the situation,  an  explosion occurred.  As  a  result  of  the  explosion,\\n4 persons were fatally injured; 1 person was seriously injured; and 10 persons, including 2 firefighters and\\n1 police  officer,  received  minor  injuries.  Six  buildings  were  destroyed.  Damage  assessments  estimated\\nproperty losses at $399,000.\\n\\nThe  major  safety  issues  identified  in  this  investigation  are  the  adequacy  of  the  safety  and  emergency\\nprocedures used by Cable Constructors, Inc., crews when working in the vicinity of underground facilities\\nand the adequacy of St. Cloud Fire Department procedures and training for responding to natural gas leaks.\\n\\nAs a  result of  its investigation of  this accident,  the Safety Board  makes safety recommendations  to  the\\nResearch and Special Programs Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the\\nAssociated General Contractors of America, the National Utility Contractors Association, the Power and\\nCommunications  Contractors  Association,  the  National  Cable  Television  Association,  the  American\\nPublic Works Association, and the International Association of Fire Chiefs.\\n\\nThe  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  is  an  independent  Federal  agency  dedicated  to  promoting  aviation,\\nrailroad, highway, marine, pipeline, and hazardous materials safety.

Report\\n\\nExecutive Summary\\n\\nAbout 10:50 a.m. on December 11, 1998, while attempting to install a utility pole\\nsupport  anchor  in  a  city  sidewalk  in  St.  Cloud,  Minnesota,  a  communications  network\\ninstallation  crew  struck  and  ruptured  an  underground,  1-inch-diameter,  high-pressure\\nplastic  gas  service  pipeline,  thereby  precipitating  a  natural  gas  leak.  About  39  minutes\\nlater,  while  utility  workers  and  emergency  response  personnel  were  taking  preliminary\\nprecautions  and  assessing  the  situation,  an  explosion  occurred.  As  a  result  of  the\\nexplosion, 4 persons were fatally injured; 1 person was seriously injured; and 10 persons,\\nincluding 2 firefighters and 1 police officer, received minor injuries. Six buildings were\\ndestroyed. Damage assessments estimated property losses at $399,000.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of\\nthis accident was the lack of adequate procedures by Cable Constructors, Inc., to prevent\\ndamage  to  nearby  utilities  when  its  anchor  installation  crews  encountered  unusual\\nconditions such as striking an underground obstacle. Contributing to the severity of the\\naccident was the delay by Cable Constructors, Inc., in notifying the proper authorities. \\n\\nThe  major  safety  issues  identified  in  this  investigation  are  the  adequacy  of  the\\nsafety and emergency procedures used by Cable Constructors, Inc., crews when working\\nin the vicinity of underground facilities and the adequacy of St. Cloud Fire Department\\nprocedures and training for responding to natural gas leaks.\\n\\nAs  a  result  of  its  investigation  of  this  accident,  the  Safety  Board  made  safety\\nrecommendations to the Research and Special Programs Administration, the Occupational\\nSafety  and  Health  Administration,  the  Associated  General  Contractors  of  America,  the\\nNational  Utility  Contractors  Association,  the  Power  and  Communications  Contractors\\nAssociation,  the  National  Cable  Television  Association,  the  American  Public  Works\\nAssociation, and the International Association of Fire Chiefs. \\n\\n\\x0c1\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFactual Information\\n\\nThe Accident\\n\\nOn December 11, 1998, a crew of four Cable Constructors, Inc., (CCI) workers\\nwas  tasked  with  installing  a  utility  pole  support  anchor1  vertically  through  a  concrete\\nsidewalk in the city of St. Cloud, Minnesota. (See figure 1.) The anchor (figure 2) was\\nbeing installed as part of a project by Seren Innovations, Inc., (Seren) to construct a fiber-\\noptic  communication  system  in  the  St.  Cloud  area.  Sirti  Ltd.  (Sirti)  had  been  hired  to\\nprovide all engineering, design, drafting, mapping, licensing, permitting and specification\\ndevelopment, and program management for the construction of the system, and CCI had\\nbeen hired to perform the actual construction work.\\n\\nFigure 1. Accident Area\\n\\n1 The anchor was a steel rod, 5 feet 6 inches long and 3/4 inch in diameter, with a closed-loop eye at the\\n\\ntop and a spoon-like helix, cut at an angle, at the bottom. The helix acts as a bit during installation.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n2\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFigure 2. Unused anchor (top) and accident anchor after removal from accident site\\n\\nBefore installation was begun, the crew foreman measured the distance from the\\nplanned anchor site to the marked location of a gas pipeline owned by Northern States\\nPower Company (NSP) and used to provide gas service to Book Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bar. Because the\\ndistance from the marked location of the pipeline to the drill site was more than 2 feet, he\\ndetermined that the installation of the anchor could proceed.2 \\n\\nThe  workers  used  a  jackhammer  to  break  about  a  9-inch-diameter  hole  in  the\\nconcrete sidewalk. They then placed an auger known as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9canchor cranker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (a gasoline-\\npowered  earth  auger  that  had  been  specially  modified  to  install  anchors)  on  top  of  the\\nanchor, and the crew began using the machine to auger the anchor into the ground. (See\\nfigure 3.) According to the workers, when the anchor had bored to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2\\nfeet, it hit something hard. The object impeding the anchor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s travel was later determined\\nto be a large granite slab about 18 inches wide, 90 inches long, and 8 inches thick. \\n\\nThe crew removed the auger and struck the top of the anchor with a sledgehammer\\nin an attempt to break up what crewmembers thought was a rock or rocks in the anchor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npath. The crew then reattached the auger to the anchor, and all four men recommenced the\\nattempt to screw the anchor into the ground. They stated that the anchor then appeared to\\nproceed normally, with no further unusual resistance, and they believed the anchor had\\nbroken through the obstacle or been deflected to the side of it. They said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceverything\\nwent fine, just as normal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d until the top of the anchor was about 12 to 18 inches from the\\nsurface. At that point, they noticed dirt blowing out of the anchor hole and immediately\\n\\n2 The distance from the marked location and the anchor site was later determined to be 38 inches. Had\\nthe distance been less than 2 feet, CCI policy and Minnesota State law would have required that the crew\\nexpose the utility line before beginning installation of the anchor. \\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n3\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFigure 3. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9canchor cranker\\xe2\\x80\\x9d auger used to install the anchor that ruptured the pipeline\\n\\nbegan to smell gas. They then stopped the auger and released it. At that point, according to\\nthe foreman, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit [the auger] just laid over towards the [utility] pole.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (See figure 4.)\\n\\nAfter telling other crewmembers to keep people off the street and away from the\\nleaking gas, the crew foreman went into Book Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bar with a crewmember to telephone\\nhis supervisor. The foreman reached the CCI site project manager about 10:51 a.m.3 and\\ntold him that his crew had struck a gas pipeline while installing an anchor. The foreman\\nlater estimated that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno more than a minute\\xe2\\x80\\x9d elapsed from the time he smelled gas to the\\ntime he made the phone call to his supervisor. \\n\\nThe  CCI  site  project  manager  told  the  foreman  to  follow  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  utility\\nstrike procedures, and he went over the procedures with the foreman. The procedures were\\ndescribed in an August 19, 1998, memorandum from Sirti to all CCI supervisors. These\\nprocedures were not written into a CCI workplace accident and injury reduction program\\nas required by Minnesota State law. In regard to notification, the procedures stated:\\n\\nAny  utility  strike  will  require  immediate  notification  of  the  utility.  If  gas,\\nimmediately  extinguish  all  ignition  sources  in  the  immediate  vicinity  such  as\\nmotors, smoking, divert all traffic in the area, notify the utility. Isolate the area by\\nbarricading to restrict access. It may also be necessary to evacuate the area....\\n\\nThe procedure did not advise supervisors to call 911. The foreman said that after\\ncompleting the call, he told the four people in the bar of the gas leak outside and informed\\nthem that they should not smoke, nor should they exit the building using the doorway near\\nthe escaping gas.\\n\\n3 Unless otherwise noted, times used in this report are based on telephone records or witness statements.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n4\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFigure 4. Anchor installation site as revealed by postaccident excavation\\n\\nThe  CCI  site  project  manager,  as  required  by  Seren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  utility  damage  reporting\\nprocedures, then telephoned the Sirti safety coordinator and told him that a gas line had\\nbeen hit. According to phone records, this call was made about 10:52 a.m. The CCI site\\nproject manager said he did not know all of the people to call in St. Cloud. The CCI site\\nproject  manager  said  the  Sirti  safety  coordinator  told  him  to  call  NSP  and  to  let  NSP\\nemployees make the emergency response calls.\\n\\nThe Sirti safety coordinator told the CCI site project manager that he (the safety\\ncoordinator) would immediately leave for the accident site, which he did. On the way, he\\nplaced a cell phone call to Seren management, informing them that a gas line had been hit\\nand he was on his way. Some time thereafter, the CCI site project manager departed his\\noffice for the accident site. Along the way, he placed a cell phone call to NSP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customer\\nservice  800  number  to  report  the  leak.  According  to  cell  phone  records,  this  call  was\\nplaced at 11:21 a.m.\\n\\nMeanwhile,  the  CCI  foreman  had  gone  back  to  the  site  to  make  sure  his\\ncrewmembers had blocked off the area. He directed that cones and orange tape be used to\\nhelp  keep  out  vehicular  traffic.  Minnesota  State  Law,  Chapter  216D.06,  required  an\\nexcavator  who  damages  an  underground  facility  to  notify  the  operator  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctake\\nimmediate action to protect the public and property and to minimize the hazard until the\\noperator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personnel or emergency responders have arrived.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d While gas was exiting the\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n5\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nground, a CCI crewmember moved the crew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aerial truck4 into Courthouse Square and to\\nthe  north  of  First  Street  North.  He  parked  the  truck  so  as  to  help  prevent  southbound\\nCourthouse Square traffic from entering First Street North. \\n\\nAfter the CCI crew  had placed cones and strung orange  tape across First Street\\nNorth  where  it  adjoined  Ninth  Avenue  North,  the  crew  waited  for  the  emergency\\nresponders (who, in fact, had not yet been called) and tried to keep people away from the\\ntaped off, secured area. The CCI foreman later said,\\n\\nFor about the first 10 minutes, we had people coming and going, and then people\\nwere  slowly  dissipating.  There  weren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  people  coming  and  going  anymore.  So\\nbasically the street was shut off.\\n\\nBy  this  time,  a  receptionist  in  the  Stearns  County  Administration  Building  was\\nreceiving complaints by telephone and from walk-ins of a strong smell of gas outside. The\\nreceptionist  relayed the  reports  downstairs  to the  office of  the  Stearns County building\\nfacilities  director.  Upon  learning  of  the  reports,  the  facilities  director  left  by  the  west\\nentrance of the administration building to investigate. Once outside, he called to have an\\nair handler turned off in the Administration Building.\\n\\nKnowing of construction on Second Street North, the facilities director approached\\nthe site and asked the excavators if they had hit a gas line. The excavators said they had\\nnot and pointed him toward the CCI workers. After walking past the police department\\nbuilding and smelling gas, he asked the CCI workers if they had damaged a gas line. The\\ncrew  foreman  told  him  they  had.  The  director  asked  if  the  crew  had  called  the  fire\\ndepartment,  and  the  crew  foreman  reported  that  they  had  not.  The  director  then,  about\\n11:05 a.m., placed a cell phone call to the Stearns County chief deputy sheriff and reported\\nthe  leak.  The  deputy  sheriff  then  called  the  sheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  department  dispatcher,  who\\nimmediately called the St. Cloud Fire Department. At 11:06 a.m., Engine Company 21,\\nbased at Fire Station 1, about 2 blocks from the leak site, was dispatched to the scene.\\nAccording to telephone records, at 11:07 a.m., the fire department dispatcher notified the\\nNSP dispatcher of the leak.\\n\\nAlso about 11:06 a.m., St. Cloud police units 41 and 42 were assigned for traffic\\ncontrol in front of Book Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bar because of the gas leak. About the same time, unit 40, a\\npolice  sergeant,  reported  that  the  area  had  already  been  barricaded  and  that  police\\nassistance was available to the fire department through the dispatcher. \\n\\nThe firefighters arrived on the scene about 11:08 a.m. According to interviews, a\\nCCI employee moved the tape to allow the engine company into the secured area. The first\\nresponders  in  the  engine  company  included  a  lieutenant  and  three  firefighters.  The\\nlieutenant said he immediately took notice of the wind direction when he arrived at the\\nsite. He later said that he planned to use the information to decide which buildings needed\\nto be evacuated first if evacuation became necessary.\\n\\n4 This truck is known as an aerial truck because it had a lift to allow workers to connect cables to utility\\n\\npoles. \\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n6\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nOne of the firefighters, accompanied by another firefighter, began testing the area\\nusing a hazardous and combustible gas monitor.5 After radio approval from his lieutenant,\\nand within a minute of arrival, the other firefighter moved the fire truck to the east end of\\nFirst Street North to eliminate a possible ignition source. \\n\\nThe Sirti safety coordinator said he arrived at the scene about 11:15 a.m. He said\\nhe parked across the street from the police station and walked to the accident site. He took\\nseveral photographs of the anchor location and the general area around the scene. \\n\\nFour vehicles were parked on First Street North next to Book Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bar. The St.\\nCloud Fire Department lieutenant told the firefighters that NSP would need to bring heavy\\nequipment into the area to repair the leak and that the vehicles would have to be moved.\\nThe lieutenant then walked to the police department building and asked that the license\\nnumbers for the parked vehicles be researched and their owners contacted. None of the\\nowners were contacted, but they all eventually came out of nearby buildings and moved\\ntheir vehicles.\\n\\nWith another firefighter at his side, the firefighter with the gas monitor first tested\\nthe  concentration  of  natural  gas  above  the  leak  site.  He  then  performed  the  same  test\\nalongside  the  buildings  housing  Book  Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Bar  and  Bellantti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Pizza  and  Deli.  The\\nfirefighter  who  carried  the  gas  monitor  said  the  area  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmelled  really  bad.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  He  said  he\\nessentially got no reading when he placed the monitor directly adjacent to the hole in the\\nground  made  by  the  anchor.  He  said  that  the  monitor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  lower  explosive  limit  (LEL)\\nreading went from -2 to 0.6 A firefighter stated that they had not had time to do a fresh-air\\ncalibration7 of the monitor because of the short distance between Fire Station 1 and the\\naccident site. \\n\\nAfter the fire truck moved to the east end of First Street North, the CCI site project\\nmanager arrived on Courthouse Square. He parked his truck on Courthouse Square so as\\nto prevent traffic from entering the east end of First Street North. With the CCI project\\nmanager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s truck on one side of Courthouse Square and the crewmember\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aerial truck on\\nthe other side, traffic could not travel from Courthouse Square toward the east end of First\\nStreet North. \\n\\nAbout  11:16  a.m.,  two  NSP  trucks  arrived.  As  was  done  earlier  for  the  fire\\ndepartment, a CCI lineman moved the tape to permit entry for both NSP trucks. An NSP\\ngas technician specialist arrived in one truck, which he parked on the street alongside the\\ndamage area. He then went to the location of the damage to assess its extent and to talk to\\nthe  CCI  foreman.  An  NSP  locator  technician  (the  individual  who  finds  and  marks  the\\n\\n5 The hazardous and combustible gas monitor used by the St. Cloud Fire Department was similar to a\\n\\ncombustible gas indicator except that it had sensors for both combustible and toxic gases. \\n\\n6 Lower explosive limit refers to the lowest concentration of a flammable gas that can be ignited. NSP\\nstandards  state  that  the  LEL  of  its  natural  gas  is  about  4.8  percent.  Gas  monitors  typically  indicate  the\\npercentage of LEL, meaning that an NSP gas monitor reading of 100 percent would indicate a natural gas\\nconcentration of about 4.8 percent. \\n\\n7 To ensure  accurate  readings,  the  monitor  is  to  be turned  on  in  fresh  air,  after  which it  automatically\\n\\ncompletes a 20-second self-test and start-up sequence.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n7\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nlocations  of  buried  utilities)  was  in  the  other  truck,  which  was  parked  behind  the  gas\\ntechnician  specialist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  truck.  With  NSP  personnel  on  scene,  two  of  the  fire  department\\nresponders joined the third already at the fire truck, while the lieutenant remained in the\\nvicinity of the leak. \\n\\nAt the anchor leak site, the NSP gas technician specialist asked the CCI foreman to\\nfill out a damage report detailing how the gas line was damaged and providing the address\\nof  the  responsible  contractor.  While  this  report  was  being  filled  out,  the  NSP  gas\\ntechnician specialist was readying his equipment. \\n\\nWitnesses  stated  that  after  the  form  was  completed,  the  NSP  gas  technician\\nspecialist entered Book Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bar at street level (the building did not have a basement).\\nInside the bar, he took readings on a combustible gas indicator and was overheard stating\\nhe obtained a reading of 7 percent.8 Bar patrons said the gas technician specialist then left\\nthe bar to look for an  entrance to the basement of the adjacent building, which housed\\nBellanti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pizza and Deli. The four persons who were in the bar during this time later told\\npolice that no one at any time asked them to evacuate the building. \\n\\nWhile the gas technician specialist was taking his readings, according to witness\\nstatements,  the  NSP  locator  technician  was  determining  if  the  service  line  had  been\\nproperly  marked.  He  was  also  seen  assisting  with the  movement  of  a  vehicle  from  the\\nsecured area. According to radio and cell phone records, about 11:29 a.m., an explosion\\noccurred in the basement of the building where Bellanti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pizza was located.\\n\\nThree firefighters were in their truck at the time of the explosion. They reported\\nthat they saw no fire but that they could see little because their vehicle was immediately\\nenveloped in a cloud of dust. Two of the firefighters exited the fire truck while the third\\nused the radio to report the explosion and request ambulance service. He said he \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknew\\nthat there were injuries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A police officer patrolling nearby also radioed a report of the\\nexplosion. After  making  the  report,  one of  the  firefighters then  moved  the  truck  to  the\\nnortheast, putting the county facilities building between the fire truck and the explosion\\nsite.\\n\\nAccording to NSP, when the NSP gas technician specialist received the call of the\\nleak, about  11:09  a.m.,  he  immediately  called  for  a  company  construction  crew,  which\\nwas equipped to shut down the damaged portion of the line. At the time of the explosion,\\nthis three-person crew was 2 blocks away from the accident site. About 11:30 a.m., the\\nNSP construction crew foreman radioed the NSP dispatcher to report the explosion. The\\nNSP dispatcher directed 26 gas technicians to the explosion site. An NSP manager stated\\nthat the technicians were sent to help close off the damaged line and to enter and check all\\nadjacent  buildings  in  the  surrounding  area  for  potential  gas-related  problems.  NSP\\nworkers  stopped  the  flow  of  gas  to  the  damaged  gas  line  at  12:25  p.m.  and  shut  off\\nelectrical power at 12:31 p.m. \\n\\n8 Although  the  gas  technician  specialist  was  killed  in  the  explosion  and  the  gas  monitor  was  not\\nrecovered,  because  NSP  employees  were  trained  to  use  their  monitors  to  measure  LEL,  the  7  percent\\nprobably referred to the LEL rather than to the concentration of gas in the air.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n8\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAccording to the report of the Minnesota State fire marshal, the explosion occurred\\nin the basement of the building where Bellanti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pizza was located.

He  had  taken  3  years  off  the  job  for  personal\\nbusiness and had returned to CCI as a lineman about 3 months before the accident. He said\\nhe had received no formal refresher training upon his return. He had been promoted back\\nto foreman about 2 weeks before the accident. \\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n9\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFigure 5. Postaccident aerial view of affected area\\n\\nOne  lineman  on  the  crew  had  been  with  CCI  for  5  1/2  months.  Another  CCI\\nlineman  had  about  3  months\\xe2\\x80\\x99  experience  before  the  accident.  This  lineman  was  a\\nmachinist  before  coming  to  CCI,  and  he  had  no  previous  communications  or  cable\\ninstallation experience. The third lineman on the crew said that he had been working for\\nCCI for only about 2 weeks but that he had 19 months\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experience as a lineman before\\njoining CCI.\\n\\nThe CCI site project manager had been working for CCI for 3 years. Before this,\\n\\nhe had worked for a cable installation company and as a self-employed cable installer. \\n\\nCCI conducted initial training for new employees. Much of the initial training was\\ntask-related and was focused toward reviewing the work that they would be performing.\\nThe initial training also entailed working in the field with experienced individuals who\\nwould show new employees the proper way to complete tasks such as pole-climbing and\\nrunning and overlashing cable. \\n\\nThe initial training covered equipment related to worker safety (hard hats, vests,\\nand cones), but it did not cover what an employee should do in the event of a natural gas\\npipeline strike. According to meeting records, pipeline strikes were addressed at a special\\nOctober 23, 1998, meeting held among Seren, NSP, Heath Consultants (utility locating),9\\nand CCI. Participants at the meeting included Seren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s director of network construction and\\n\\n9 Utility companies sometimes use utility-locating services rather than their own employees. \\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n10\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\noperations,  CCI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  site  project  manager,  and  NSP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  district  operations  manager  and\\ndamage prevention coordinator. Although Sirti was the safety project coordinator, no one\\nfrom Sirti is listed as attending this meeting. The meeting covered related subjects such as\\nlocating underground facilities.\\n\\nAccording to the meeting minutes, the meeting was held because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNSP and Seren\\ntogether decided that we needed a meeting to better control  the situation we have with\\nsafety as it related to locating gas and electric services, particularly given recent incidents\\nthat have occurred.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d According to officials, a number of incidents had occurred in which\\nyellow-paint  locate marks  had  not  been  placed  directly  above  the  underground  facility.\\nBefore the meeting, NSP had been contracting out its utility locating to Heath Consultants.\\nAs a result of the meeting, NSP assigned two full-time utility locators to the Seren project\\nand put the contract locator under the direct supervision of an NSP locator. To help ensure\\nthat  locate  marks  were  located  directly  above  underground  facilities,  the  idea  of  pre-\\nconstruction  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwalkouts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  was  discussed,  along  with  the  need  for  daily  meetings  at\\nexcavation sites between the locator and Seren excavators to pinpoint utility locations. It\\nwas  determined  that  improved  mapping  and  map  reading  would  also  help  ensure  that\\nlocate marks would be placed directly above underground facilities. During the meeting,\\nthe  CCI  site  project  manager  specified  the  need  for  a  24-inch  distance  between  the\\nexcavation and the locate marks.\\n\\nEmergency procedures for Seren contractors were also discussed at the October 23\\nmeeting. The topic discussion started when Seren\\xe2\\x80\\x99s director of network construction and\\noperations asked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce we do have a strike, what is the procedure?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d NSP officials then\\nsaid they would send out a person immediately and that police and fire departments would\\nbe needed to keep the crowds away. Later in the meeting, NSP provided attendees with a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctip sheet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d containing a step-by-step process in the event an underground natural gas line\\nshould be struck during excavation or other construction. The tip sheet advised workers\\nfirst  to  shut  down  all  equipment  in  the  immediate  area,  then  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCall  911  and/or  radio\\ndispatcher and request that they call 911 to alert the Fire and Police Departments.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d No tip\\nsheet or written emergency procedures were available at the site of the accident. \\n\\nCCI  construction  crews  were  required  to  attend  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstruction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  meetings  every\\nWednesday  at  10  a.m.  According  to  CCI,  at  these  meetings,  workers  would  discuss\\nincidents  that  occurred  during  the  previous  week.  These  Sirti-run  meetings  were  also\\ncalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9csafety meetings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because Sirti maintained a log of utility strikes, and the workers\\nwould analyze how an incident occurred and how a similar incident could be prevented in\\nthe future. \\n\\nSirti\\n\\nThe  Sirti  safety  coordinator  who  responded  to  the  accident  had  completed  a\\nMinnesota  Safety  Council  course  entitled  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn  Introduction  to  Occupational  Safety\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in\\nJune 1998. \\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n11\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nNSP\\n\\nThe NSP gas technician specialist initially sent to check the leak was killed in the\\nexplosion. Company records show that the technician had completed the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGas\\nEmergency  Training\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  course  in  February  1998  and  had  completed  the  final  course test\\nwith no errors. \\n\\nThe locator technician who responded to the leak was also killed. He had taken the\\ngas emergency training course in February 1995 and had passed the final test. He had also\\ntaken a course entitled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecognizing Emergency Conditions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in August 1995. He was not\\nrequired  to  take  the  training  course  annually  because  he  was  not  a  gas  operations\\nemployee  and therefore would not  respond to  a  gas  leak in  the same capacity as  a gas\\ntechnician. Because NSP is also the provider of electric power for St. Cloud, the locator\\ntechnician  would  locate  both  electric  and  gas  underground  facilities.  He  had  been  the\\nindividual who had marked the location of the pipeline before the anchor installation was\\nbegun,  and  he  went  to  the  site  to  verify  that  he  had  properly  marked  the  pipeline\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlocation. \\n\\nAccording to NSP officials, the company offered a number of courses designed to\\nprepare  NSP  employees  to  respond  to  gas  emergencies.  The  officials  stated  that  the\\ntraining has a special section on outside leak emergencies and that a considerable part of\\nthis  section  is  about  leak  classification  guidelines.  Leak  classifications  involve  the\\nvolume, location, area, system pressure, concentration, duration, and spread rate of a leak.\\nCompany representatives said employees were taught that a leak classification involves\\nthe possible migration of the gas and the proximity of a leak to a building foundation. The\\ngas  emergency  training  course  lesson  plans  state  that  experience  is  imperative  in\\nevaluating a leak and assigning repair priority and that experience is needed to recognize\\nwhere gas may be migrating. \\n\\nIn addition to the above training, NSP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s St. Cloud office gas operations employees\\nwere required to attend a half-day  fire school during the summer and 90-minute safety\\nmeetings  each  month.  These  meetings  covered  17  planned  subjects  such  as  carbon\\nmonoxide safety,  heat  stress,  and  winter  safety. An NSP  training  officer  stated  that  the\\nsafety meetings were less structured or planned than the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s training courses. None\\nof  the  safety  meetings  specifically  covered  the  procedures  needed  in  the  event  of  an\\nunderground gas leak next to a building. \\n\\nThe  NSP  Gas  Safety  Training  Department  required  that  new  gas  operations\\nemployees  go  through  a  formal  apprenticeship  program.  On  an  ongoing  basis,  all  gas\\noperations employees are required to take a first-aid course every 3 years and 11 different\\ncourses  annually.  Required  courses  included  confined  space  work,  excavation  and\\nshoring, and gas emergency training.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n12\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nPipeline Operations\\n\\nNSP completed the original installation of the gas service line serving Book Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nBar on October 29, 1982. The polyethylene main and service pipelines were installed for\\nuse  at  7  inches  water  column  pressure  (approximately  1/4  psig).  According  to  the\\ncompany,  NSP  planned  to  possibly  upgrade  the  system  later  to  high  pressure,  and  the\\npipelines were tested to 100 psig after installation. An excess flow valve (EFV) was not\\nrequired by regulation and was not installed. \\n\\nRecords  show  that  the  service  pipeline  and  meter  set  to  Book  Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Bar  were\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cuprated\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  to  high  pressure  on  August  19,  1998.  No  excavation  was  done  to  uprate  the\\npipeline. The service pipeline meter set was changed to fit a high-pressure, 60 psig system,\\nand the service pipeline was again tested to 100 psig. After August 19, 1998, and at the\\ntime of the accident, the pipeline operating pressure at the outlet of the regulator station\\nwas about 60 psig.\\n\\nBackground of Accident\\n\\nOn  March  10,  1998,  a  contract  was  completed  between  Seren,  a  fully  owned\\nsubsidiary  of  NSP,  and  Sirti.  The  contract  stipulated  that  Sirti  would  provide  all\\nengineering,  design,  drafting,  mapping, \\nlicensing,  permitting,  and  specification\\ndevelopment  for  the  construction  of  a  two-way  fiber-optic  telecommunications  system\\nthroughout the St. Cloud area. \\n\\nOn  July  15,  1998,  Seren  authorized  Sirti  to  provide  the  construction  project\\nmanagement services for the St. Cloud telecommunications system. As project manager,\\nSirti  would  coordinate  all  construction  and  testing  activities  and  administer  all\\ncontractor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s documents. Contract correspondence between Seren and Sirti indicated that\\nSirti would hire a safety manager who would prepare a safety manual and be responsible\\nfor enforcing all Federal and State regulations.\\n\\nOn  August  5,  1998,  Seren  signed  a  contract  with  CCI  to  construct  the\\ntelecommunications  system  throughout  the  St.  Cloud  area.  Although  Sirti  was  already\\nchosen to be the project and safety manager, the contract between Seren and CCI had no\\nmention of Sirti.  CCI officials  were aware  that Sirti  was  the project manager, and  CCI\\nsubleased office and warehouse space from Sirti. CCI started field construction under this\\ncontract on August 10, 1998. \\n\\nOn December 8, 1998, after using the Gopher State One-Call system, CCI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s aerial\\nconstruction manager met with eight underground facility operators,10 including NSP, and\\ninformed them of the locations where CCI planned to install utility-pole support anchors.\\n\\n10 The  underground  facility  operators  included  the  city  of  St.  Cloud,  the  city  of  Waite  Park,  TCI\\nCablevision, the State of Minnesota Department of Transportation, Norstan Communications, NSP, Seren,\\nand U.S. West (telephone).\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n13\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nThe facility operators marked their facilities in these areas. CCI planned to do the work at\\nthese  sites  between  December  8  and  December  11.  The  One-Call  ticket  was  for  21\\nlocations. \\n\\nMeteorological Information\\n\\nAccording  to  weather  data  recorded  at  the  St.  Cloud  airport,  at  the  time  of  the\\naccident, the skies were clear and the wind was blowing out of the southwest at 8 mph.\\nClimatological data for the city of St. Cloud indicate that the weather for a month before\\nthe accident was unseasonably mild, with the average temperature being 10.7\\xc2\\xb0 F warmer\\nthan normally recorded for that time of year. Had it not been for the unseasonably warm\\nweather,  CCI  would  have  had  to  postpone  the  anchor  installations  because  of  frozen\\nground. \\n\\nMedical and Pathological Information\\n\\nFour people were fatally injured in the accident, including the NSP gas technician\\nand the NSP locator. Also killed were a pedestrian walking outside the taped-off area and\\na tenant of one of the rented rooms above Bellantti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pizza. The tenant was found in the\\nbasement of the collapsed building with debris beneath and over his body. Cause of death\\nin each case was multiple traumatic injuries due to natural gas explosion. \\n\\nEleven people, including two firefighters and one police officer, were injured. An\\nemployee of the law offices, one of four trapped persons extricated from the rear of the\\nlaw  offices  building,  sustained  serious  injuries  from  falling  debris.  The  remaining  10\\npeople received minor injuries, including abrasions, lacerations, and inhalation injuries.\\nThey were treated at St. Cloud Hospital and released. \\n\\nU.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) rules for postaccident alcohol and drug\\ntesting (49  Code of Federal  Regulations  (CFR)  199.3 and 11(b)) do not  cover workers\\nsuch  as  CCI  employees  at  the  scene  of  the  gas  explosion  or  those  involved  in  the\\nexcavation  activities  that  preceded  the  accident.  Covered  employees  are  those  persons\\nwho perform operating, maintenance, or emergency response functions regulated by 49\\nCFR Parts 192, 193, or 195. \\n\\nAfter  discussions  with  NSP  and  Seren,  CCI,  about  10  hours  after  the  accident,\\ndirected five involved employees to St. Cloud Hospital for the collection of specimens.\\nThe five employees included the crew, the crew foreman, and the project manager, who\\nwas the first member of management to be notified of the leak. Arrangements were made\\nfor  MedTox  Laboratories,  Inc.,  in  St.  Paul,  Minnesota,11  to  collect  the  specimens  and\\n\\n11 MedTox  Laboratories,  Inc.,  was  on  a  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  list  of\\n\\nlaboratories meeting minimum standards to perform urine drug testing.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n14\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nperform the tests. According to the times indicated on the MedTox laboratory sheets for\\nthe blood and urine test reports, the earliest specimen collection was 9:35 a.m. on the day\\nof the accident, and the last collection was 10 a.m. the next day.12 The other collections\\nwere recorded as taking place between 10:30 p.m. and 11:20 p.m. on December 11. The\\nMedTox  test  results  for  alcohol  in  blood  were  positive  at  or  above  0.02  g/dl  for  one\\nemployee. For another employee, marijuana metabolite was present in urine at or above\\nthe 15 ng/ml level. \\n\\nThe Safety Board asked the crewmembers about their activities between the time\\nof the accident and the time their specimens were collected. They said they returned to the\\nshop for their paychecks. On the way home, they went together to a bar and had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseveral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ndrinks.  The  foreman  said  that  he  drank  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccouple\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  more  beers  when  he  got  home.\\nEveryone  on the  crew said that they  had not  consumed  alcohol or used drugs  within  8\\nhours of reporting for work on the morning of the accident.\\n\\nThe  specimens  remaining  after  the  MedTox  tests  were  shipped  to  the  Civil\\nAeromedical Institute (CAMI) for additional testing at the request of the Safety Board.\\nThe CAMI tests revealed the presence of alcohol and marijuana in the specimens of two of\\nthose tested. \\n\\nAccording  to  CCI  officials,  after  the  accident,  the  company  began  requiring\\n\\npreemployment drug screening and conducting random drug testing of its employees. \\n\\nSurvival Aspects\\n\\nEmergency Response After the Explosion\\n\\nImmediately  after  the  explosion,  one  engine  company  each  responded  from  St.\\nCloud Fire Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fire Stations 2 and 3, and a ladder truck responded from Fire\\nStation 1. Fire department personnel notified Gold Cross Ambulance Service to respond\\nand  requested  heavy  excavation  equipment.  Crewmembers  of  Engine  Company  21,\\nalready on scene, began search and rescue operations immediately.\\n\\nFour people were trapped inside the rear portion of the Hall law offices, which was\\nbetween the Bellantti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s building and Tom\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bar. Three of those trapped were extricated by\\nfirefighters within 20 minutes. Some 30 minutes after that, the fourth person was freed and\\ntaken  to  the  hospital.  None  of  these  individuals  reported  seeing  any  NSP  or  fire\\ndepartment personnel before the explosion. \\n\\nAt 11:30 a.m., St. Cloud Police Department Unit 43 advised the Stearns County\\nSheriff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department dispatcher of the explosion. All available ambulances were asked to\\n\\n12 MedTox forms for one employee show the time of urine collection as 9:35 a.m. on December 11, which\\nwas about 2 hours before the explosion. The time shown for collection of a blood specimen for the same\\nemployee was 10 a.m. on December 12, the day following the accident. The Safety Board asked for but did\\nnot receive information from MedTox that would explain these discrepancies. \\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n15\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nrespond to the scene, as were all available law enforcement personnel. A request was also\\nmade for construction equipment. \\n\\nAbout the same time, the St. Cloud fire chief and the assistant fire chief, who was\\nthe incident commander, arrived on scene. At 11:31 a.m., the St. Cloud Police Department\\nbegan evacuating the immediate area, including Courthouse Square and the north side of\\nthe  courthouse  building.  At  this  time,  all  of  the  St.  Cloud  off-duty  firefighters  and\\nvolunteer division firefighters were  called to report to duty. At 11:32  a.m., a command\\npost was established 100 feet west of the intersection of Ninth Avenue North and First\\nStreet North and a staging area was established at the rear of Fire Station 1. Also about\\n11:32 a.m., Engine 21 firefighters notified the incident commander that they were going to\\nbegin  evacuation  of  the  Stearns  County  courts  facilities  building.  At  11:33  a.m.,  the\\nincident  commander  requested  additional  NSP  personnel  because  of  the  gas  leak  and\\ndowned electrical wires. The first ambulance arrived at 11:34 a.m.\\n\\nAt 11:37 a.m., the fire chief activated the St. Cloud Emergency Action Plan. At\\n11:38  a.m.,  the  fire  chief  asked  for  help  from  the  Waite  Park  and  Sauk  Rapids  fire\\ndepartments. \\n\\nAt  11:42  a.m.,  the  St.  Cloud  police  established  an  evacuation  perimeter.  This\\nperimeter included the Law Enforcement Center, the courthouse, and the Stearns County\\nAdministration Building. \\n\\nAt 11:44 a.m., Gold Cross Ambulance Service called the St. Cloud Hospital and\\ninformed the emergency trauma center charge nurse of the gas explosion and advised her\\nthat approximately 20 patients possibly could be transported to the hospital. Subsequently,\\nthe  hospital  evaluated  its  resources  and  determined  that  three  air  ambulances  were\\navailable to transport patients to burn centers if necessary. \\n\\nBy 11:47 a.m., all injured survivors, with the exception of the seriously injured and\\ntrapped victim, had been  removed  from  the  immediate  area  surrounding  the  explosion.\\nThe evacuation perimeter was further secured using police line tape and road barricades\\nwith security checkpoints established.\\n\\nAt  11:50  a.m.,  the  owner  of  the  building  housing  Bellantti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Pizza  informed  a\\npolice  supervisor  that  two  rooms  on  the  second  floor  of  the  Bellantti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  building  were\\nrented. At 12:07 p.m., the incident commander called for the Anoka County Search and\\nRescue Canine unit. \\n\\nAt 12:09 p.m., St. Cloud Hospital initiated its disaster plan and notified 50 medical\\nprofessionals  to  respond  to  an  upper  floor  staging  area.  The  emergency  trauma  center\\nmonitored  the  activities  of  the  ambulance  crews  on  site  and  was  kept  informed  on  the\\nconditions of patients and their transportation to the hospital. A total of 11 people were\\neither transported by ambulance or arrived by private vehicle at the hospital. At 1:30 p.m.,\\nthe hospital\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disaster plan was discontinued.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n16\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAt 1:51 p.m., the Anoka County Search and Rescue Canine Unit arrived on scene.\\nAt 2:24 p.m., St. Cloud police received reports that two individuals had been in a rented\\nroom  above  Bellantti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  at  the  time  of  the  explosion.  At  3  p.m.,  the  police  department\\nconfirmed  that  all  four  people  who  had  been  inside  Book  Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Bar  at  the  time  of  the\\nexplosion  had  been  accounted  for.  At  3:05  p.m.,  police  officers  were  assigned  to  start\\ndoor-to-door checks within the affected area. At the same time, Red Cross workers were\\non site at a nearby home for senior citizens to assist with a possible evacuation. \\n\\nSearch  and  rescue  operations  continued  with  the  use  of  manual  and  heavy\\nequipment until approximately 10 p.m., in the event that more victims were buried in the\\ndebris; however, none were found. At 10 p.m., the St. Cloud Police Department and the\\n34th Military Police Company of the Minnesota National Guard secured the area for the\\nnight. NSP continued operations in the area, restoring power and gas service to the senior\\ncitizens home and to other buildings in the area.\\n\\nDisaster Preparedness\\n\\nThe city of St. Cloud implemented its disaster plan for the accident. The purpose\\nof the basic plan was to ensure the effective, coordinated use of the resources available to\\nthe city so as to: (1) maximize the protection of life and property; (2) ensure the continuity\\nof government; (3) sustain survivors; and (4) repair essential facilities and utilities. Prior\\nto  the  accident,  the  most  recent  certification  of  the  plan  by  local  authorities  was\\nSeptember 9, 1998.\\n\\nThe  last  full-scale  disaster  drill  conducted  by  the  city  of  St.  Cloud  before  the\\naccident  was  on  May  21,  1998.  The  drill  simulated  an  airplane  accident  at  St.  Cloud\\nairport. According to hospital officials, St. Cloud Hospital routinely performs two internal\\ndisaster drills annually.\\n\\nFire Department Procedures and Training\\n\\nAlthough  all  of  the  fire  department  responders  were  trained  on  the  basic\\ncharacteristics of natural gas, at the time of the accident, the St. Cloud Fire Department\\nhad no written procedures in place providing detailed guidance on responding to natural\\ngas  leaks.  The  firefighters  were  instructed  during  in-house  training,  State-sponsored\\ntraining,  and  training  sponsored  by  NSP  to  be  aware  of  wind  direction  as  well  as  the\\ngeneral characteristics of natural gas. The American Gas Association\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (AGA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) pamphlet\\nA Guide to Controlling Natural Gas in Emergencies was also reviewed and distributed by\\nNSP.  Prepared  by  the  AGA  as  a  guide  to  firefighters,  the  pamphlet  provides  a  brief\\noverview of natural gas and its characteristics. In a section dealing with steps to take when\\ngas is escaping outside a building, the pamphlet recommends:\\n\\nIf unignited gas is escaping from the ground, from an excavation or from an open\\npipe outside a building - NOTIFY THE GAS COMPANY IMMEDIATELY. A\\nsafe  area  surrounding  the  location  should  be  cleared,  roped  or  barricaded.\\nExtinguish  all  open  flames.  Prohibit  smoking.  Check  surrounding  buildings,\\ncellars in particular, for any presence of gas odors. Restrict or reroute all traffic\\nuntil gas company personnel can bring the gas flow under control.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n17\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nThis pamphlet outlined the actions to take in the event of an underground gas leak\\n\\nnext to a building.\\n\\nNSP trains its employees that gas can migrate underground. As a part of its public\\nawareness program (see next section), NSP provides information and instructional classes\\nto  fire  departments  on  the  hazards  of  natural  gas.  Before  the  accident,  the  most  recent\\ntraining class regarding natural gas had been provided to the St. Cloud Fire Department in\\nOctober 1995. \\n\\nNSP Public Awareness Program\\n\\nAccording to company officials, NSP has a public awareness plan for the safety of\\nthe public and contractors working in and around natural gas. The plan covers excavation\\nsafety, and the information is communicated through radio, television, and newspaper ads,\\nin  addition  to  billing  inserts.  All  forms  of  communication  emphasize  the  need  to  call\\nGopher  State  One-Call  before  excavating.  Some  forms  of  communication,  especially\\nnewspaper ads and billing inserts, include whom to call for carbon monoxide problems,\\ngas leaks, or incidents when the odor of natural gas is detected. The ads and inserts state\\nthat in the case of a suspected gas leak, a person should evacuate a building, should not\\nturn  on  any  light  switches,  and  should  call  NSP  from  outside  the  building.  Excavation\\nsafety  includes  working  with  various  groups  such  as  the  Gopher  State  One-Call,  the\\nMetropolitan  Utility  Coordinating  Committee,  the  Minnesota  Utility  Contractors\\nAssociation, and other groups to prevent excavation damage.\\n\\nInvestigation\\n\\nSite Description\\n\\nPostaccident  Safety  Board  investigation  revealed  a  yellow  paint  mark  on  the\\nsidewalk in direct line with two other yellow paint marks, one over and perpendicular to\\nthe  curb  and  another  on  the  sidewalk  closer  to  Book  Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  The  paint  marks  ran  in  a\\nstraight line toward a gas riser located inches from the Book Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s building wall. Each of\\nthe paint marks was about 2 feet long and was directly over the gas service pipeline. \\n\\nGas Monitor Testing\\n\\nFour  days  after  the  accident,  with  fire  department  and  Safety  Board  personnel\\npresent, the gas monitor readings that were obtained by firefighters at the accident scene\\nbefore the accident were downloaded from the memory device within the monitor, and the\\nmonitor was calibrated. The calibration of the monitor was tested by exposing the unit to a\\ncalibration gas with a concentration that was 50 percent of LEL. When tested against this\\ngas, the monitor registered 34 percent of LEL. Also, the timing mechanism on the monitor\\nwas in error by about 4 minutes. \\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n18\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nPrevious Underground Facility Strikes\\n\\nAlthough the gas line location in this accident was accurately marked, during the\\ninvestigation, the Sirti safety manager stated that an NSP locating contractor had done a\\npoor  locating  job  in  the  past.  Sirti  submitted  to  the  Safety  Board  a  list  of  37  previous\\nunderground  facility  strikes,  with  several  attributed  to  improperly  located  or  unmarked\\nunderground facilities.\\n\\nNSP records showed that as a result of excavator error, CCI and its subcontractor\\nhad previously damaged NSP natural gas pipelines, including incidents on October 7 and\\n30,  1998.  CCI  had  also  damaged  NSP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  underground  electrical  facilities  and  the\\nunderground  facilities  of  others.  About  1  year  before  this  accident,  CCI  had  struck  a\\ntelephone cable and was cited and fined by the Minnesota Office of Pipeline Safety.\\n\\nAccording \\n\\nto  NSP,  while  Seren \\n\\ninstalling\\ntelecommunications  in  the  St.  Cloud  geographic  area,  they  had  damaged  underground\\nnatural  gas  facilities  in  15  locations  (including  the  accident  location)  over  a  4-month\\nperiod. In about half of the incidents listed, damage was attributed to improper locating.\\n\\ncontractors \\n\\nhad \\n\\nbeen \\n\\nSeren subcontractors other than CCI had also damaged NSP natural gas pipelines.\\nOn  December  2,  1998,  a  Seren  contractor  damaged  a  gas  main.  The  St.  Cloud  Fire\\nDepartment responded and NSP had to bypass the leak to avoid disrupting service to about\\n100 customers.\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nEvents Following the Accident\\n\\nAfter the accident, the Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration\\n(MNOSHA) cited CCI for not having a written plan to avoid damage to the underground\\ngas  lines  in  and  near  the  construction  area  and  for  not  having  a  complete  workplace\\naccident and injury reduction (AWAIR) program. The CCI program did not list methods\\nto identify, analyze, and control existing hazards. MNOSHA also cited Sirti and Seren for\\nnot having a complete AWAIR program. \\n\\nFollowing  the  accident, Seren  replaced CCI as  a contractor  for  the project. The\\nnew contractor was removed after it too was involved in damaging underground facilities.\\nTo prevent further incidents, the companies involved and local authorities jointly decided\\nthat  all  future  Seren  contractors  would  be  required  to  undergo  training  with  NSP.\\nAdditionally, NSP would have a safety inspector at each site when anchors were being\\ninstalled.\\n\\nAs part of its postaccident activities, the St. Cloud Fire Department developed, in\\nconjunction  with  NSP,  standard  operating  guidelines  for  responding  to  natural  gas\\nemergencies. The guidelines state that gas can migrate underground into buildings, that\\ngas  monitors  should  be  used  both  outside  and  inside  buildings  to  check  for  the\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n19\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nconcentration of gas, that ignition sources should be eliminated and buildings ventilated,\\nand that people in the vicinity should be evacuated to a safe area. The department has also\\nrevised its standard operating procedures to direct that firefighters (1) not rely exclusively\\non gas monitors  to  detect  gas  concentrations, (2) eliminate  possible  sources of ignition\\nuntil  the  leak  is  stopped,  (3)  evacuate  people  and maintain  site security,  and (4) detect\\npossible underground migration by checking buildings, manholes, and confined spaces in\\nthe affected area. The procedures note that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit can take several hours for the Gas Company\\nto shut off gas in a large high-pressure pipeline.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIn  a  June  5,  2000,  letter  to  the  Safety  Board,  the  St.  Cloud  Fire  Department\\noutlined steps it had taken to ensure the proper calibration of its gas monitors and noted\\nthat NSP had provided the department with three gas monitors that NSP calibrates and\\nmaintains. \\n\\nSince the accident, the city of St. Cloud has adopted a right-of-way management\\nordinance and hired a specialist to manage the ordinance. The ordinance requires people\\nworking in an area designated as having critical facilities (high-risk areas) to submit a gas\\nsafety plan with all their permit applications. The ordinance imposes certain requirements\\nfor work in these areas depending on the nature of the work and the risks involved. The\\ncity, in conjunction with industry representatives, has mapped all the critical facility areas.\\n\\nAfter  the  accident,  CCI  established  a  new  safety  and  health  program  patterned\\nafter  the  Minnesota  State  AWAIR  program.  The  company  hired  a  full-time  safety\\nmanager. CCI had all company project managers attend a 10-hour construction awareness\\nclass. CCI also reported to the Safety Board that it has enhanced its employee training.\\nCCI now has procedures in place that require 911 to be called immediately in the event a\\ngas line is ruptured. \\n\\nEffective August 1, 1999, the State of Minnesota revised Minnesota Statute 216D\\nto require any excavator who breaches a pipeline containing hazardous gas or liquid to\\nimmediately notify 911. The law states, in part:\\n\\nIf  any  damage  occurs  to  an  underground  facility  or  its  protective  covering,  the\\nexcavator  shall  notify  the  operator  promptly.  When  the  operator  receives  a\\ndamage notice, the operator shall promptly dispatch personnel to the damage area\\nto  investigate.  If  the  damage  results  in  the  escape  of  any  flammable,  toxic,  or\\ncorrosive  gas  or  liquid  or  endangers  life,  health,  or  property,  the  excavator\\nresponsible  shall  immediately  notify  the  operator  and  the  911  public  safety\\nanswering point...and take immediate action to protect the public and property.\\n\\nThe  director  of  the  Minnesota  Division  of  Emergency  Management  told  Safety\\nBoard  investigators  that  State  911  emergency  call  centers  had  recorded  no  noticeable\\nincrease in calls to 911 since enactment of the law and that, in the opinion of the official,\\nthe law has ensured more timely notification of authorities after excavation damage. \\n\\n\\x0c20\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe explosion in the St. Cloud accident occurred in the building housing Bellanti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nPizza and Deli. The escaping natural gas from the damaged pipeline apparently migrated\\nunderground, through  the crumbling  foundation of the  building, and into the  basement.\\nThere, exposed to several potential sources of ignition, it exploded. \\n\\nBecause  of  the  delay  in  notifying  the  gas  company  and  emergency  response\\npersonnel, about 18 minutes elapsed from the time the pipeline was ruptured until the first\\nfirefighters arrived (about 21 minutes before the explosion). About 26 minutes after the\\nrupture (about 13 minutes before the explosion), gas company personnel arrived. An NSP\\ngas technician specialist was assessing the hazard when the explosion occurred.\\n\\nThe  major  safety  issues  identified  in  this  investigation  are  the  adequacy  of  the\\nsafety  and  emergency  procedures  used  by  CCI  crews  when  working  in  the  vicinity  of\\nunderground  facilities  and  the  adequacy  of  St.  Cloud  Fire  Department  procedures  and\\ntraining for responding to natural gas leaks.\\n\\nThe remainder of this analysis addresses factors that were eliminated as causal or\\n\\ncontributory to this accident, followed by a discussion of the major safety issues.\\n\\nExclusions\\n\\nNSP marked the location of a nearby gas service line before the CCI construction\\ncrew  began  installing  the  utility  pole  anchor  through  the  sidewalk  next  to  the  building\\nhousing  Book-Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Bar  and  Bellanti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Pizza.  Postaccident  excavations  confirmed  the\\naccuracy of the paint marks that indicated the location of the natural gas line. The Safety\\nBoard concludes that the marked location of the ruptured gas line was accurate and was\\ntherefore not a factor in this accident.\\n\\nThe CCI crew knew immediately that they had struck and ruptured a gas line when\\nthey  saw  dirt  blowing  back  around  the  anchor  and  smelled  gas,  and  they  took  actions\\nconsistent with procedures  established by  the company.  The foreman  promptly notified\\nCCI management of the leak, and the crew began restricting public vehicle access to the\\narea. \\n\\nToxicological  testing  of  blood  and  urine  specimens  revealed  that  alcohol  or\\nmarijuana,  or  both,  was  present  in  some  of  the  involved  employees;  however,  the\\nspecimens were collected after the employees had returned to their homes for the evening,\\nand the testing could not determine how much alcohol was ingested or when the alcohol\\nand marijuana had been used. \\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n21\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nNo  one  reported  observing  any  actions  that  could  be  construed  as  indicating\\nimpairment  on  the  part  of  individuals  in  the  crew  who  tested  positive  for  alcohol  or\\nmarijuana  while  those  employees  were  working  on  the  morning  of  the  accident.\\nMoreover, the crew\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collective actions after the leak showed prompt and full compliance\\nwith  CCI  procedures,  as  well  as  with  the  instructions  given  to  the  foreman  on  the\\ntelephone  by  the  project  manager.  The  Safety  Board  therefore  concludes  that  while\\ntoxicological testing performed after this accident was not useful for determining whether\\nalcohol or drugs had any influence on the performance of the CCI crewmembers while\\nthey  were  installing  the  anchor,  the  crewmembers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  actions before  and  after  the  rupture\\nindicate that they were likely not impaired by alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident.\\n\\nThe Accident\\n\\nInstallation of the anchor was begun some 38 inches from the marked location of\\nthe underground gas line. This distance was 14 inches beyond the 2-foot margin provided\\nfor in CCI procedures and Minnesota State law to allow for a possible error in the marking\\nof the location of the gas line. But while this 38-inch distance appeared to be adequate to\\nensure a safe installation, the length of the anchor was about 66 inches. At this length, the\\nanchor  could  easily  span  the  distance  from  the  entry  point  to  the  pipeline  if  it  were\\ninstalled at an angle rather than vertically. \\n\\nThe  CCI  crew  stated  that  they  intended  to  install  the  anchor  vertically,  and  no\\nevidence  was found to indicate that  the anchor  did  not enter  the ground vertically.  But\\nwhen  the  anchor  struck  the  buried  granite  slab,  the  crewmembers  followed  their\\ncustomary practice and struck the top of the anchor with a hammer until they perceived\\nthat the anchor had broken through the obstacle or had deflected off to its side. As the\\ninvestigation  later  determined,  the  anchor  had  not  broken  through  but  had  bent  and\\ndeflected. The anchor apparently continued to bend as the four men applied pressure to the\\nanchor cranker in their attempt to complete the installation. The investigation determined\\nand postaccident excavation revealed that the anchor bent and followed along the upper\\nsurface of the buried granite slab until the cutting helix on the anchor tip dropped off the\\nend of the slab, thus striking and rupturing the pipeline. \\n\\nCCI  procedures  for  protecting  underground  utilities  did  not  address  the  risks\\nassociated  with  abnormal  conditions  underground  that  could  render  normal precautions\\ninadequate. The Safety Board found no evidence that anchor installation crews were made\\naware that even if installation is begun at a safe distance from a buried utility, safety can\\nbe compromised if the anchor is allowed to assume an angled path underground. Such a\\ndeflection  could  endanger  an  underground  utility  and  present  a  risk  to  the  public.  The\\nSafety Board concludes that CCI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anchor installation procedures were inadequate in that\\nthey  did  not  address  steps  to  take  under  unusual  circumstances  (such  as  striking  a\\nsignificant underground obstacle) to ensure that buried utilities were protected during the\\nentire installation process, including the underground portion.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n22\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nIn  its  investigation  of  a  July  21,  1997,  accident  in  Indianapolis,  Indiana,13  the\\nSafety Board found that adequate controls were not in place to prevent an underground\\npipeline from being damaged during directional drilling, even though indications above\\nground were that an adequate safety margin was being observed. In the view of the Safety\\nBoard, excavation procedures are inadequate if they do not account for the possibility that\\nunusual  conditions  could  negate  otherwise  effective  attempts  to  protect  buried  utilities.\\nThe Safety Board therefore believes that the Associated General Contractors of America,\\nthe National Utility Contractors Association, the Power and Communications Contractors\\nAssociation, the National Cable Television Association, and the American Public Works\\nAssociation should advise their memberships to review and revise their anchor installation\\nprocedures as necessary to ensure that safety margins around buried utilities are absolutely\\nobserved not only above ground but throughout the installation process.\\n\\nContractor Response\\n\\nWithin  1  minute  of  striking  the  gas  line,  the  CCI  crew  foreman,  following  the\\nprocedures his company had established for such an emergency, informed his supervisor\\nof  the  incident.  But  the  supervisor  did  not  immediately  notify  emergency  response\\nagencies. Instead, he called the Sirti safety coordinator, telling him that he did not know\\nwhom to call. The safety coordinator told him to call NSP and let NSP employees notify\\nemergency  response  agencies.  The  Sirti  safety  coordinator  then  departed  for  the  scene.\\nAlong the way, he called Seren management to inform them of the leak. \\n\\nBy  this  time,  then,  several  operational  and  management  levels  of  the  involved\\ncompanies knew of the leak, yet no one had notified emergency response agencies. In fact,\\nabout 15 minutes elapsed before another individual, not associated with the construction\\nproject, notified emergency responders. The CCI supervisor did eventually call the owner\\nof the gas line but not until about 30 minutes after the line was struck. By this time, two\\nNSP employees were already on the scene, the company having been notified by the fire\\ndepartment dispatcher. \\n\\nHad either the crew foreman or his supervisor immediately called 911, responders\\ncould have been on the scene within minutes. For example, a fire department vehicle and\\nfour firefighters were on the scene within about 2 minutes of being notified, but because of\\nthe  delayed  notification,  they  arrived  some  18  minutes  after  the  rupture  and  about  21\\nminutes before the explosion.\\n\\nOnce on scene, the gas technician specialist determined by meter reading that the\\ngas concentration in Book-Em\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bar, at 7 percent of LEL, was some 93 percent below the\\nminimum concentration necessary for an explosion to occur. Because of the proximity of\\nthe leak to the bar, this level could have been the result of gas entry through the door of the\\nbuilding. According to witness statements, the gas technician specialist left the bar to find\\n\\n13 National  Transportation  Safety  Board.  1999.

Before he arrived there, however,\\nthe explosion occurred, and he was killed. With an earlier start to evaluating the risk of the\\nsituation, the gas technician specialist may have been able to determine that gas was, in\\nfact,  accumulating  in  the  basement  of  the  Bellanti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  building.  The  gas  company  and\\nemergency responders may then have decided to evacuate everyone from nearby buildings\\nand out of the area. Additional steps may have been taken to eliminate ignition sources\\nand ventilate the basement. In such an event, the explosion may have been prevented or, at\\na minimum, some of the people at risk could have been removed from the area.\\n\\nThe Safety Board concludes that had the crew foreman or his supervisor called 911\\nor  the  utility  owner  immediately  after  the  rupture,  emergency  responders  and  NSP\\npersonnel may have had time to fully assess the risk and to take actions that could have\\nhelped either to prevent the explosion or to avoid the resulting loss of life.\\n\\nto  prevent  excavation  damage.14  The  study \\n\\nIn  1997,  the  Safety  Board  published  a  safety  study  that  discussed  industry  and\\ngovernment  actions \\nformalized\\nrecommendations  aimed  at  further  advancing  improvements  in  excavation  damage\\nprevention programs. One area given prominence was emergency procedures applicable\\nwhen a utility is damaged during excavation. The safety study noted that while Federal\\nregulations  require  pipeline  operators  to  establish  written  emergency  procedures,  the\\nregulations do not apply to excavators, even though \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthese are the very people that often\\nhave responsibility for first response at an excavation disaster.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The study concluded that,\\nat a minimum, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexcavators should formulate an emergency response plan appropriate for\\nthe  specific  construction  site  and  ensure  that  employees  working  at  that  site  know  the\\ncorrect action to take if a buried facility is damaged.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Safety Board therefore made the\\nfollowing safety recommendation to the American Public Works Association (APWA):\\n\\nP-97-30\\nDevelop  guidelines  and  materials  that  address  initial  emergency  actions  by\\nexcavators when buried facilities are damaged and then distribute this information\\nto all one-call notification centers.\\n\\nThe  APWA  responded  on  January  26, 1998, stating that the  organization would\\nlike to meet with the Safety Board to discuss the APWA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to implement the safety\\nrecommendations in the package that contained P-97-30. The Board replied on March 12,\\n1998,  placing  the  recommendations  in  an  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen\\xe2\\x80\\x94Await  Response\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  status  pending  the\\noutcome of a meeting. A meeting was held on March 12, 1998, and the APWA agreed to\\nlook  at  the  package  of  recommendations  and  advise  the  Board  regarding  which  of  the\\nactions the APWA could accomplish. The APWA failed to respond further, and the Safety\\nBoard, in a June 7, 2000, letter, asked the APWA to provide information about its efforts\\nto  implement  the  safety  recommendations.

The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nregarding contact names and numbers states that\\n\\nThe  excavator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  designated competent  person  at  each  job  site  has  access to  the\\nnames and phone numbers of all facility owner/operator contacts and the one-call\\ncenter. \\n\\nIn the St. Cloud accident, no one at the site had contact names and numbers. Not\\neven the CCI site project manager had such a list; he told the Sirti safety coordinator that\\nhe did not know whom to call to report the leak. \\n\\nThe  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest  practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  statement  for  notification  of  emergency  personnel  is  as\\n\\nfollows:\\n\\nIf the protective coating of an electrical line is penetrated or gases or liquids are\\nescaping  from  a  broken  line  which  endangers  life,  health  or  property,  the\\nexcavator immediately contacts local emergency personnel or calls \\xe2\\x80\\x98911\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to report\\nthe damage location.\\n\\nThe  National Utility  Locating  Contractors Association (NULCA)  has developed\\nguidelines for excavation practices and procedures for damage prevention.

The  project  was\\ninitiated  by  the  DOT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety,  an  element  of  the  Research  and  Special  Programs\\nAdministration,  in  response  to  the  Transportation  Equity  Act  for  the  21st  Century,  Public  Law  105-78,\\nsigned into law June 9, 1998. The purpose of the year-long study was to identify and validate existing best\\npractices performed in connection with preventing damage to underground facilities.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n25\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\ncontractors notify 911 in the event of damage to buried utilities if the damage results in the\\nescape of  any flammable, toxic, or corrosive  gas  or liquid  or endangers life,  health, or\\nproperty. The wording of the Minnesota law relieves excavators of the responsibility of\\ndetermining  whether  damage  represents  a  hazard  before  they  call  911  and  the  utility\\nowner.  The  Safety  Board  prefers  this  approach  to  that  of  the  Common  Ground  best\\npractice or the NULCA guidelines. \\n\\nIn  the  view  of the  Safety  Board,  the  utility  owner  and  911 or  other  appropriate\\nemergency  notification  number  should  be  called  any  time  a  hazardous  substance  is\\nreleased from a pipeline through construction damage, regardless of whether those on the\\nscene  perceive  an  immediate  danger  to  public  safety.  Excavators  are  not  all\\nknowledgeable about what constitutes a hazardous situation. For example, they may not\\nbe familiar with the hazards of gas migrating underground, or they may not realize that a\\npulled  pipeline  could  be  broken  in  more  than  one  place.  Emergency  responders  can\\nusually  arrive  at  the  scene  quickly  and  are  often  trained  and  equipped  to  assess  such\\nhazards and take appropriate safety measures. \\n\\nStrengthened requirements to notify utility owners immediately in the event of any\\ndamage to a pipeline can also increase safety. The sooner the experts from the operator are\\nnotified,  the  sooner  they  can  apply  their  knowledge  to  reduce  the  public  safety  risks.\\nWhereas some contractors may previously have waited until the end of the day to report\\ndamage to pipelines that did not appear to present an obvious threat, requiring immediate\\nnotification  of  operators  could  possibly  help  them  prevent  a  minor  problem  from\\ndeveloping into a major hazard. Some damage may not result in an immediate leak but\\nmay represent  a hazard  in the  future.  The  pipeline operator can determine if corrective\\nmeasures are needed to prevent a future failure. If an immediate pipeline leak does occur,\\nthe  utility  owner  is  in  the  best  position  to  be  aware  of  the  hazards  associated  with  the\\nproduct  in  its  pipelines  and  the  appropriate  safety  countermeasures,  and  to  be  able  to\\nshorten the time until a leak can be stopped. \\n\\nAdditionally, \\n\\nin \\n\\nthe  notification\\nrequirement will increase awareness on the part of contractors and other excavators of the\\nimportance of taking care not to damage utilities, and a reduction in the number of such\\nincidents may be expected. \\n\\nthe  Safety  Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  view,  strengthening \\n\\nTo help ensure that this issue is addressed on a nationwide basis, the Safety Board\\nbelieves that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) at the Federal\\nlevel should require excavators to notify the pipeline operator immediately if their work\\ndamages  a  pipeline  and  to  call  911  or  other  local  emergency  response  number\\nimmediately if the damage results in a release of natural gas or other hazardous substance\\nor potentially endangers life, health, or property.\\n\\nIn the meantime, until OSHA can act on this recommendation, the Safety Board\\nbelieves  that  the  Path  Forward  initiative  (discussed  below  in  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcavation  Damage\\nPrevention\\xe2\\x80\\x9d section) should promote the immediate notification of the utility owner and\\nemergency agencies whenever excavation damage to a utility results in a release of natural\\ngas or other hazardous substance or otherwise presents a threat to public safety. Because\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n26\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nthe DOT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Research  and  Special Programs  Administration  (RSPA) was instrumental  in\\nthe creation of the Path Forward initiative, that agency should, through the mechanism of\\nPath  Forward  initiative,  take  the  lead  in  promulgating  an  industry  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest  practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  that\\nadvises excavators to  notify the  pipeline operator immediately if their work damages  a\\npipeline  and  to  call  911  or  other  local  emergency  response  number  immediately  if  the\\ndamage  results  in  a  release  of  natural  gas  or  other  hazardous  substance  or  potentially\\nendangers life, health, or property.\\n\\nTo further raise awareness of the early notification issue, the Safety Board believes\\nthe Association of General Contractors, the National Utility Contractors Association, the\\nPower and Communications Contractors Association, and the National Cable Television\\nAssociation should publicize the circumstances of this accident to their memberships to\\nmake  them  aware  of  the  dangers  of  damage  to  an  underground  utility  and  the  need  to\\nimmediately  call  911  or  other  appropriate  local  emergency  response  number  when  a\\nnatural  gas  leak  or  other  hazardous  condition  occurs  and  to  immediately  notify  utility\\ncompanies when an underground facility has been damaged.\\n\\nFire Department Response\\n\\nAn engine company with a lieutenant and three firefighters arrived within minutes\\nof fire department notification. Firefighters attempted to take gas concentration readings\\nwith a gas monitor, but the monitor had not been calibrated in fresh air and gave invalid or\\nunreliable  readings.  Firefighters  continued  to  attempt  readings  with  the  improperly\\ncalibrated instrument, all the while working in an environment in which they described the\\ngas smell as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpretty bad.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At no point did firefighters check buildings near the leak site to\\ndetermine  if  natural  gas  was  accumulating  or  to  help  assess  the  need  for  a  possible\\nevacuation,  even  though  the  gas  line  was  continuing  to  release  gas  that  could  migrate\\nthrough  the  ground  and  into  nearby  buildings,  where  it  could  present  a  danger  of\\nexplosion. Two of the firefighters near the leak site returned to their truck as soon as two\\ngas  company  employees  arrived.  It  should  have  been  obvious  to  the  firefighters  that  a\\nthreat continued to exist and that the situation could worsen. \\n\\nThe  Safety  Board  therefore  concludes  that  firefighters  of  the  St.  Cloud  Fire\\nDepartment responded quickly to the scene of the leak; however, once on the scene, the\\nfirefighters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 actions did not fully address the risk to people and property posed by the leak\\nor reduce the consequences of a possible fire or explosion.\\n\\nAs  part  of  its  postaccident  activities,  the  St.  Cloud  Fire  Department  developed\\nguidelines  for  natural  gas  emergency  response  that  address  the  issues  identified  in  this\\naccident.  According  to  fire  department  officials,  revisions  to  procedures  have  been\\ndeveloped that should help prevent a similar accident in the future in the St. Cloud Fire\\nDepartment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response area. In the view of the Safety Board, all first responders should be\\nprepared to respond effectively to a gas leak hazard. \\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n27\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nTimely,  effective  response  to  a  natural  gas  emergency  can  save  lives.  In  an\\nOctober  30,  1998,  accident  in  Chicago,  Illinois,  excavation  work  damaged  a  24-inch-\\ndiameter natural gas main.16 The natural gas ignited about 40 minutes later, causing major\\nfire and heat damage to a nearby 15-story high-rise apartment building. Responding fire\\nand police personnel completely evacuated the high-rise building before the gas ignited,\\nwith the result that no one was injured in the accident. \\n\\nThe Safety Board believes that the International Association of Fire Chiefs should\\npublicize the circumstances of the St. Cloud, Minnesota, accident to their membership to\\nmake them aware of the potential dangers of gas migrating into buildings from damaged\\nunderground  gas  lines.  The  Safety  Board  further  believes  that  the  association  should\\nadvise its membership of the need to determine the hazards posed by natural gas leaks and\\nthe value of having an evacuation plan in place to be used when the situation warrants.\\n\\nExcavation Damage Prevention \\n\\nThe  Safety  Board  has  long  been  concerned  about  the  numbers  of  accidents\\nattributable  to  excavation  damage.  In  May  1997,  the  Safety  Board  added  excavation\\ndamage prevention to its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost Wanted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d list of safety improvements.17 Data maintained\\nby  RSPA  indicate  that  damage  from  outside  force  is  the  leading  cause  of  leaks  and\\nruptures  to  pipeline  systems,  accounting  for  more  than  40  percent  of  reported  failures.\\nInvestigation  of  the  St.  Cloud  accident  alone  revealed  a  high  incidence  of  excavation\\ndamage to utilities, by different contractors, both before and after the accident. \\n\\nA  1994  workshop  sponsored  jointly  by  the  Safety  Board  and  RSPA  brought\\ntogether about 400 people representing pipeline operators, excavators, trade associations,\\nand  local,  State,  and  Federal  government  agencies  to  identify  and  recommend  ways  to\\nimprove  prevention  programs.  The  Safety  Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  1997  safety  study  was  initiated  to\\nanalyze the findings of the 1994 workshop, to discuss industry and government actions\\nundertaken  since  the  workshop,  and  to  make  recommendations  to  further  reduce\\nexcavation damage accidents. \\n\\nThe safety study addressed employee qualifications and training, which has been\\nan  issue  in  a  number  of  excavation-caused  pipeline  accidents.  To  address  training  and\\nqualifications of those not covered by Federal regulations, the Safety Board, on January 6,\\n1998, issued the following safety recommendation to the APWA:\\n\\n16 Illinois  Commerce  Commission,  September  1999,  Report  of  the  ICC  Staff:  Incident  at  1507  North\\n\\nClaybourn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois, October 30, 1998.\\n\\n17 In October 1990, the Safety Board developed the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMost Wanted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d list, drawn up from previously issued\\nsafety recommendations, to bring special emphasis to the safety issues the Board deems most critical. The\\nMost Wanted list is updated as needed.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n28\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nP-97-29\\nReview  existing  training  programs  and  materials  related  to  excavation  damage\\nprevention  and  develop  guidelines  and  materials  for  distribution  to  one-call\\nnotification centers.\\n\\nThis recommendation has the same history as Safety Recommendation P-97-30,\\n\\ndiscussed earlier, and is classified \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen\\xe2\\x80\\x94Await Response.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe safety study noted the progress that had been made since 1994 by RSPA and\\nthe industry  in the  area of improving excavation damage prevention programs. But  the\\nstudy  concluded  that  despite  improvements  in  State  excavation  damage  prevention\\nprograms, additional efforts were needed to uniformly develop and implement programs\\nthat are most effective. On January 6, 1998, the Safety Board therefore addressed Safety\\nRecommendation  P-97-15  to  RSPA  and  P-97-25  to  APWA  asking  that  the  two\\norganizations work in conjunction to:\\n\\nP-97-15 and -25\\nInitiate  and  periodically  conduct...detailed  and  comprehensive  reviews  and\\nevaluations  of  existing  State  excavation  damage  prevention  programs  and\\nimprovements,  where  warranted,  such  as  full\\nrecommend  changes  and \\nparticipation,  administrative  enforcement  of \\nthe  program,  pre-marking\\nrequirements, and training requirements for all personnel involved in excavation\\nactivity.\\n\\nBased  on  an  October  30,  1998,  RSPA  response  to  Safety  Recommendation\\nP-97-15 and on a meeting of representatives from RSPA and the Safety Board to discuss\\nongoing  actions  to  address  the  intent  of  the  recommendation,  Safety  Recommendation\\nP-97-15 was classified \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen\\xe2\\x80\\x94Acceptable Response\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on June 29, 1999. \\n\\nIn an April 24, 2000, letter to the Safety Board, RSPA responded in general terms\\nto 29 Safety Board recommendations, including P-97-15. The letter outlined the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nefforts  to  create  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cself-sustaining  private  sector  non-profit  organization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  that  would\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprovide  an  effective  forum  for  information  sharing  among  all  stakeholders  in  damage\\nprevention.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These efforts, known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDamage Prevention: Path Forward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d initiative,18\\nare intended to continue the efforts begun with the Common Ground study and to address\\nthe issues involved in preventing outside force damage to the underground infrastructure.\\nWorking  committees  having  been  established  to  direct  the  formal  establishment  of  the\\nPath  Forward  program.  The  Safety  Board  is  encouraged  by  the  promise  of  the  Path\\nForward  program  and  will  follow  the  development  of  the  program  with  interest.  The\\nclassification  for  P-97-15  will  remain  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen\\xe2\\x80\\x94Acceptable  Response\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  pending  further\\naction by RSPA.\\n\\nThe Board is also disappointed by the lack of response from the APWA to Safety\\nRecommendation P-97-25. That recommendation has followed the same history as Safety\\n\\n18 A  new  nonprofit  organization,  the  Common  Ground  Alliance,  is  being  formed  to  continue  the  Path\\n\\nForward initiative. \\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n29\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nRecommendations  P-97-29  and  -30,  discussed  earlier,  and  remains  classified  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nAwait Response.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nExcess Flow Valves\\n\\nExcess flow valves (EFVs) are available that respond to an excessive flow of gas\\nby automatically closing and restricting the gas flow. EFVs therefore can greatly reduce\\nthe consequences of service line ruptures. \\n\\nThe Safety Board initially advocated using EFVs on service lines to schools and\\nother  buildings  in  which  large  numbers  of  people  gather.  Later,  because  EFVs  became\\ncheaper and more available, the Safety Board began advocating the installation of EFVs\\non new or renewed residential service lines. During the 1980s, RSPA, which has oversight\\nresponsibilities  over  the  pipeline  industry,  failed  to  require  EFVs.  Consequently,  the\\nSafety  Board  included  the  use  of  EFVs  on  its  1990  list  of  Most  Wanted  safety\\nimprovements.\\n\\nOn September 26, 1990, as a result of its investigation of five natural gas accidents\\n\\nin the Kansas City-Topeka area, the Safety Board recommended that RSPA:\\n\\nP-90-12\\nRequire the installation of excess flow valves on new and renewed single-family,\\nresidential high pressure service lines which have operating conditions compatible\\nwith  the  rated  performance  parameters  of  at  least  one  model  of  commercially\\navailable excess flow valve.\\n\\nOn  April  4,  1995,  RSPA  notified  Congress  by  letter  that  it  had  decided  not  to\\nrequire universal installation of EFVs and instead would issue performance standards and\\ncustomer-notification requirements for EFVs. In a September 28, 1995, letter to RSPA,\\nthe  Safety  Board  expressed  its  disappointment with  this  decision.  The  Board  noted  the\\ncontinued strong evidence that a way was needed to quickly restrict the flow of gas to a\\nfailed pipe segment. On September 28, 1995, as a result of RSPA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to issue EFV\\nrequirements,  the  Safety  Board  classified  Safety  Recommendation  P-90-12  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClosed\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nUnacceptable Action.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nOn March 6, 1996, as a result of its investigation of a June 9, 1994, natural gas\\nexplosion  in  Allentown,  Pennsylvania,  the  Safety  Board  wrote  to  the  governors  of  all\\n50 States  and  to  the  mayor  of  the  District  of  Columbia  asking  that  they  require  gas\\ndistribution  operators  to  install  EFVs  in  all  new  or  replaced  gas  service  lines  when\\noperating  conditions  are  compatible  with  commercially  available  valves  (Safety\\nRecommendation P-96-3). Of the States that replied, most advised that they intended to\\nfollow the lead of RSPA and had no plans to require the installation of EFVs. The State of\\nMinnesota did not respond to Safety Recommendation P-96-3.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n30\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAlso on March 6, 1996, the Safety Board recommended that RSPA:\\n\\nP-96-2\\nRequire  gas  distribution  operators  to  notify  all  customers  of  the  availability  of\\nexcess flow valves; any customer to be served by a new or renewed service line\\nwith  operating  parameters  that  are  compatible  with  any  commercially  available\\nexcess  flow  valve  should  be  notified;  an  operator  should  not  refuse  to  notify  a\\ncustomer  because  of  the  customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  classification  or  the  diameter  or  operating\\npressure of the service line. \\n\\nOn February 3, 1998, RSPA issued its final rule regarding EFVs. The rule requires\\ngas  distribution  operators  either  to  install  EFVs  on  new  or  replaced  single-residence\\nservice  lines  expected  to  operate  continuously  at  not  less  than  10  psig  or  to  inform\\ncustomers of the availability and benefits of EFVs and install them if the customer agrees\\nto pay for their installation and maintenance. \\n\\nOn October 6, 1998, the Safety Board classified this recommendation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cClosed\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nUnacceptable Action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in part because the RSPA rule limits required notifications by gas\\noperators  to  residential  customers.  As  in  the  case  in  the  St.  Cloud  accident,  many\\ncommercial service lines have operating characteristics compatible with the same EFVs\\nthat will be installed in residential service lines.\\n\\nAccording to an American Gas Association survey, since the issuance of the RSPA\\nfinal rule on EFVs, approximately one-half of the operators of gas distribution systems\\nhave elected to install EFVs, and one-half have developed procedures to inform customers\\nof their availability. NSP\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current policy, put in place after the St. Cloud accident, is to\\ninstall EFVs on all new or replaced service lines that fit the operating requirements of its\\napproved EFVs, regardless of whether the customer is residential or commercial.\\n\\nBecause no further action can reasonably be expected to be taken either by RSPA\\nor the States, the Safety Board, on May 3, 2000, removed the recommendations regarding\\nEFVs from its Most Wanted list. In a July 5, 2000, letter to the Governor of Minnesota, the\\nSafety Board asked for information about Minnesota\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intentions with respect to Safety\\nRecommendation P-96-3. Until Minnesota responds to the Safety Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s latest request\\nfor  information,  Safety  Recommendation  P-96-3  to  the  State  of  Minnesota  will  be\\nclassified \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen\\xe2\\x80\\x94Unacceptable Action.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\n\\nWhen NSP converted the gas service line from low pressure to high pressure, the\\nline  itself  was  not  replaced;  therefore,  the  most  recent  Safety  Board  recommendations\\nregarding EFVs would not have applied to this service line. Nonetheless, the Safety Board\\nis convinced of the usefulness of EFVs in preventing pipeline accidents and concludes that\\nhad the gas line in this accident been equipped with an EFV, the valve may have closed\\nafter the pipeline ruptured and the explosion may not have occurred.\\n\\n\\x0c31\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFindings\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\n1. The marked location of the ruptured gas line was accurate and was therefore not a\\n\\nfactor in this accident.\\n\\n2. While  the  toxicological  testing  performed  after  this  accident  was  not  useful  for\\ndetermining whether alcohol or drugs had any influence on the performance of the\\nCable  Constructors,  Inc.,  crewmembers  while  they  were  installing  the  anchor,  the\\ncrewmembers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 actions before and after the rupture indicate that they were likely not\\nimpaired by alcohol or drugs at the time of the accident.\\n\\n3. Cable Constructors, Inc.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anchor installation procedures were inadequate in that they\\ndid  not  address  steps  to  take  under  unusual  circumstances  (such  as  striking  a\\nsignificant underground obstacle) to ensure that buried utilities were protected during\\nthe entire installation process, including the underground portion.\\n\\n4. Had the crew foreman or his supervisor called 911 or the utility owner immediately\\nafter  the  rupture,  emergency  responders  and  Northern  States  Power  personnel  may\\nhave had time to fully assess the risk and to take actions that could have helped either\\nto prevent the explosion or to avoid the resulting loss of life.\\n\\n5. Firefighters of the St. Cloud Fire Department responded quickly to the scene of the\\nleak; however, once on the scene, the firefighters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 actions did not fully address the\\nrisk to people and property posed by the leak or reduce the consequences of a possible\\nfire or explosion.\\n\\n6. Had the gas line in this accident been equipped with an excess flow valve, the valve\\nmay have closed after the pipeline ruptured and the explosion may not have occurred.\\n\\nProbable Cause\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of\\nthis accident was the lack of adequate procedures by Cable Constructors, Inc., to prevent\\ndamage  to  nearby  utilities  when  its  anchor  installation  crews  encountered  unusual\\nconditions such as striking an underground obstacle. Contributing to the severity of the\\naccident was the delay by Cable Constructors, Inc., in notifying the proper authorities. \\n\\n\\x0c32\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\nNew Recommendations\\n\\nAs a result of its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board makes the\\n\\nfollowing safety recommendations:\\n\\nTo the Research and Special Programs Administration:\\n\\nThrough  the  mechanism  of  the  Path  Forward  initiative,  take  the  lead  in\\npromulgating an industry \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbest practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that advises excavators to notify\\nthe pipeline operator immediately if their work damages a pipeline and to\\ncall  911  or  other  local  emergency  response  number  immediately  if  the\\ndamage results in a release of natural gas or other hazardous substance or\\npotentially endangers life, health, or property.

Approximately\\n140,400 gallons1  of  fuel  oil  were  released  into  the  surrounding  wetlands  and  Swanson\\nCreek and, subsequently, the Patuxent River as a result of the accident. No injuries were\\ncaused by the accident, which cost approximately $71 million for environmental response\\nand clean-up operations.\\n\\nThe Accident\\n\\nAt the time of the accident, Pepco was the owner of the Piney Point Oil Pipeline\\nsystem. ST Services, a limited partnership of the Kaneb Pipe Line Company, operated the\\npipeline  and  performed  certain  maintenance  functions  according  to  the  terms  of  its\\ncontract with Pepco.2 The pipeline was used to deliver heated No. 6 fuel oil from Piney\\nPoint Terminal, in Maryland, through an intermediate station at Ryceville, Maryland, to\\nPepco(cid:146)s power generating stations at either Chalk Point or Morgantown, Maryland. (See\\nfigure 2.)\\n\\nOn  April 7,  2000,  a  pigging  operation  was  being  conducted  on  the  pipeline  to\\nprepare the Chalk Point Station to Ryceville Station segment of the pipeline for an in-line\\ninspection. The pipeline from the Chalk Point Station to the Ryceville Station was started\\nin the reverse direction of normal flow with flushing oil3 in the system. (See figure 3 for a\\nschematic  of  the  pipeline.)  Employees  calculated  the  amount  of  oil  in  the  Chalk  Point\\nflushing  oil  tank  and  the  Ryceville  receiving  tank  before  the  operation  began.  As  the\\noperation  proceeded,  they  obtained  tank  level  data  that  would  typically  be  used  to\\ndetermine how much oil had been pumped from Chalk Point and how much had been\\nreceived by Ryceville.\\n\\n1 Pipeline  operators  typically  quantify  their  product  using  barrels  rather  than  gallons.  There  are\\n\\n42 gallons in a barrel.\\n\\n2 In December 2000, Pepco sold some of its facilities, including the Piney Point Oil Pipeline and the\\nChalk Point Generating Station, to Southern Energy, Inc., of Atlanta, Georgia. Southern Energy later became\\nMirant Mid-Atlantic of Atlanta, Georgia. Currently, Mirant Piney Point, LLP, (Mirant) is the pipeline owner\\nand operator.\\n\\n3 Flushing oil is a mixture of No. 2 and No. 6 fuel oil. No. 6 fuel oil is a thick, black petroleum liquid\\nthat may become solid at cooler temperatures. No. 2 fuel oil is a light, refined petroleum product similar to\\ndiesel fuel.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n2\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nMARYLAND\\n\\nRt 301\\n\\nPRINCE GEORGE\\'S\\n\\nCOUNTY\\n\\nOil Spill Site\\n\\nPEPCO - Chalk Point\\n\\nGenerating Station\\n\\nCHARLES\\nCOUNTY\\n\\nSwanson Creek\\n\\nCALVERT\\nCOUNTY\\n\\nBenedict\\n\\nRoute 231\\n\\nST.

Before this operation began,\\nthe  estimated  tank  level  that  would  indicate  completion  of  the  pigging  process  was\\ncalculated for Chalk Point. The first pig was initially estimated to arrive at the Ryceville\\nStation  7 hours  after  it  had  been  launched.  Before  launching  the  cleaning  pig,  the  ST\\nServices  Chalk  Point  operator  walked  through  the  tank  and  pipe  manifold  area  and\\nmeasured the actual level4 of the flushing oil tank. Within 15 to 25 minutes, a sizing pig5\\nwas launched to follow the cleaning pig.\\n\\nThe ST Services Chalk Point operator measured the first tank level at 0910. He\\npassed this information on to the crew at Ryceville, who had the tank volume conversion\\ntables that were used to determine the volume in the tank and calculate the oil flow rate.\\nThe first tank gauge was read at Ryceville shortly after the crew arrived, about 0837.

The  ST  Services\\nRyceville operator kept some notes during the pumping but did not record the time and\\ntank level information in the station log.\\n\\nTank levels were taken at Chalk Point to be used to check the flow rate from the\\nfacility  at  about  2-hour  intervals  for  most  of  the  pumping  operation.  The  ST  Services\\nRyceville operator said he read the tank gauge at Ryceville, the receiving station, about\\nevery 1 1/2 hours to determine the volume of product in the Ryceville tank. The operating\\npersonnel did not provide tank volumes to the ST Services Chalk Point operator, and they\\ndid not calculate the line balance6 periodically during the pigging operation. Further, they\\ndid not communicate the tank level information to the ST Services Piney Point pipeline\\ncontroller7 when it was obtained.\\n\\nAt 1119, another tank level measurement was made at Chalk Point, and the ST\\nServices  Chalk  Point  operator  passed  the  information  on  to  the  ST  Services  Ryceville\\noperator. A few minutes before 1200, the ST Services Chalk Point operator told Ryceville\\nthat the pumping was going well and that the cleaning pig would arrive early, between\\n1300 and 1330. At the same time, the ST Services Chalk Point operator asked Ryceville\\nwhat  it  was  getting  for  volume  received,  as  he  had  not  had  any  confirmation  on  the\\nproduct pumped from his station to Ryceville. Ryceville told him the station was working\\non  it.  As  a  normal  check-in,  the  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  also  called  the  ST\\nServices Piney Point pipeline controller to inform him that he was at the station and that\\nthings were going fine.\\n\\nThe next Chalk Point tank level measurement was taken at 1220 and reported to\\nRyceville and Piney Point. The ST Services Chalk Point operator stood by the Chalk Point\\npump starting about 1250 and was prepared to shut it down whenever he received a call\\nfrom Ryceville stating that the cleaning pig had arrived. The tank gauge was checked at\\nRyceville  about  1300,  but  no  information  on  the  volume  received  was  calculated  or\\nreported to the ST Services Chalk Point operator or the ST Services Piney Point pipeline\\ncontroller. The ST Services Ryceville operator went outside to the Ryceville pipe manifold\\nabout 1300 to await the cleaning pig(cid:146)s arrival. About 1412, the ST Services Chalk Point\\noperator  decided  to  double-check  the  Chalk  Point  tank  level  because  the  pig  had  not\\narrived at Ryceville.\\n\\nAbout  1430,  the  Chalk  Point  pump  started  cavitating8  due  to  a  low-pressure\\ncondition at the pump inlet, because the level of product in the tank was not providing\\nsufficient pressure for the pump to run properly. About the same time, the ST Services\\nRyceville operator noticed that Ryceville(cid:146)s meter noise suddenly stopped, indicating no\\n\\n6 Line balance is the difference between the volume of product pumped at the origin and the volume\\nreceived at the destination.

The ST Services Chalk Point operator kept the pump operating by partially\\nclosing the pump outlet valve in an effort to avoid internal damage to the pump.\\n\\nThe  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  talked  to  the  ST  Services  maintenance\\nforeman at Ryceville and was told that the meter noise had stopped and no pig had arrived.\\nThe ST Services Chalk Point operator was then directed to close the valve as much as\\npossible to maintain product flow. The ST Services Chalk Point operator had not taken a\\nrecent  tank  level  measurement  but  was  now  ordered  by  the  ST  Services  maintenance\\nforeman to determine the Chalk Point tank level. The ST Services Ryceville operator was\\nalso  directed  to  measure  the  Ryceville  tank  level  so  that  the  volume  pumped  could  be\\ncompared  with  the  volume  received.  The  ST  Services  assistant  terminal  manager  was\\nnotified  about  the  situation,  and  he  confirmed  the  need  for  an  immediate  tank  level\\nmeasurement of the pumping and receiving tanks.\\n\\nThe  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  and  the  ST  Services  assistant  terminal\\nmanager  had  a  phone  conversation  about  1440  and  reviewed  the  situation.  The  ST\\nServices assistant terminal manager instructed the ST Services Chalk Point operator to\\ndouble-check which valves were closed to confirm that the No. 6 fuel system was isolated\\nfrom the flushing oil system.\\n\\nTank  levels  were  acquired  for  Chalk  Point  and  Ryceville.  The  ST  Services\\nRyceville  operator,  using  the  tank  volume  tables,  calculated  that  enough  oil  had  been\\npumped  for  the  pigs  to  have  reached  the  Ryceville  Station.  He  said  he  thought  that\\nsomething was wrong because Ryceville did not receive all the oil pumped from Chalk\\nPoint.\\n\\nThe ST Services assistant terminal manager later said that at the time he believed\\nthat the tank volume discrepancy had been caused by a valve that was improperly aligned\\n(open to another tank) or leaking (product leaking through a valve to another tank) and\\nthat  flushing  oil  was  being  transferred  to  the  No. 6  fuel  oil  tank.  He  then  directed  ST\\nServices employees to make a number of checks to confirm that the correct valves were\\nopen, to obtain a reading of the No. 6 fuel oil meters at Chalk Point, and to measure the\\ntanks  at  Piney  Point.  The  ST  Services  assistant  terminal  manager  had  the  ST  Services\\nPiney Point pipeline controller perform the line balance calculations, with the result that\\n3,088.7 barrels (129,725 gallons) could not be accounted for.\\n\\nBy  1534,  after  receiving  the  additional  information  he  had  requested,  the  ST\\nServices assistant terminal manager stated that the discrepancies could not be explained\\nby tank inventory data. He had ruled out the possibility of the missing oil being anywhere\\nit  should  be.  During  a  phone  call,  the  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  told  the  ST\\nServices assistant terminal manager that the requested check had confirmed the isolation\\nof  the  flushing  oil  system  from  the  No. 6  fuel  oil.  The  ST  Services  assistant  terminal\\nmanager told the ST Services Chalk Point operator to shut the Chalk Point pump down. At\\n1538,  the  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  shut  down  the  pump.  The  ST  Services\\nassistant  terminal  manager  stated  that  he  paged  his  Pepco  pipeline  contact,  the  Pepco\\nChalk Point general supervisor for fuel and ash, three times using a (cid:147)911 code(cid:148) to indicate\\nthe  urgent  need  for  a  response.

The  ST  Services  assistant  terminal\\nmanager then directed the ST Services Chalk Point operator to check the No. 1 valve pit\\narea at Swanson Creek for a leak and to look across the creek at the No. 2 valve pit for\\nsigns of a leak. (Valve pit No. 1 is on the north side of Swanson Creek, between the creek\\nand  the  Chalk  Point  Station.)  The  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  also  obtained  the\\nclosing tank level for the Chalk Point flushing oil tank.\\n\\nThe  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  made  the  visual  checks  by  1545  and\\nreported that he saw no sign of an oil leak at the creek. Next, the ST Services Chalk Point\\noperator was directed to check all roads that the pipeline crossed back to Ryceville for an\\noil  leak.  He  called  the  Chalk  Point  Operations  Center  and  stated  that  he  was  finished\\npumping  and  that  the  pigs  had  not  been  received  at  Ryceville,  indicating  there  was  a\\nproblem with the pipeline. He said he told the Chalk Point Operations Center that he was\\nchecking road crossings and would contact the center if he noticed a leak or some other\\nproblem.\\n\\nAt 1550, the ST Services assistant terminal manager called a Pepco Washington,\\nD.C., headquarters oil procurement employee who confirmed the pager number for the\\nPepco  Chalk  Point  general  supervisor  for  fuel  and  ash.  The  contact  also  provided  the\\nPepco engineering supervisor(cid:146)s phone number, because the Pepco engineering supervisor\\nmight  be  able  to  locate  other  contacts  needed  by  the  ST  Services  assistant  terminal\\nmanager.\\n\\nThe  ST  Services  assistant  terminal  manager  contacted  the  Pepco  engineering\\nsupervisor, who advised him that the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for fuel and\\nash was on vacation. The ST Services assistant terminal manager told him the details of\\nthe 3,000-barrel line balance discrepancy and was advised to call the Pepco Chalk Point\\ngeneral supervisor for operations. The ST Services assistant terminal manager also stated\\nthat ST Services personnel were checking the levels of the flushing oil and No. 6 fuel oil\\ntanks at Chalk Point, Morgantown, and Piney Point to determine the location of a 3,000-\\nbarrel line balance discrepancy. The ST Services assistant terminal manager indicated that\\nsimilar discrepancies had occurred in the past due to valve misalignment or valves not\\nbeing fully closed, which allowed oil to be inadvertently directed into one of the other oil\\nstorage tanks in the system.\\n\\nThe Pepco engineering supervisor said that about 1620, he called the Pepco Chalk\\nPoint general supervisor for operations and informed him of a 2,000- to 3,000-barrel line\\nbalance discrepancy, which the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations noted\\nin his log as a discrepancy of 2,000 barrels. The Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for\\noperations  also  noted  in  his  log  that  ST  Services  personnel  had  initiated  a  ground\\ninspection and were checking the pipeline at road crossings. At 1643, the Pepco Chalk\\nPoint general supervisor for operations ordered a patrol flight of the pipeline right-of-way.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n10\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nResponse to Accident\\n\\nNotifying Authorities and Containing Spill\\n\\nApril 7. About 1800 or shortly thereafter, the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor\\nfor  operations  called  the  on-duty  Pepco  environmental  coordinator,  who  was  the\\ndesignated  Pepco  qualified  individual,9  at  home  to  discuss  the  pipeline  line  balance\\nshortage.  He  told  the  Pepco  qualified  individual  what  was  being  done  at  the  pipeline,\\nincluding the tank level measurement discrepancy found when oil had been pumped back\\nto Ryceville. The Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations also said that he\\nhad ordered a pipeline patrol flight.\\n\\nAt  1802,  the  ST  Services  assistant  terminal  manager  learned  that  during  the\\npipeline  patrol  plane  flight,  an  oil  release  from  the  Piney  Point  Oil  Pipeline  had  been\\nspotted in the Swanson Creek wetlands area. By 1807, the ST Services assistant terminal\\nmanager  had  put  the  Chalk  Point  pipeline  emergency  response  plan  into  effect  by\\ncontacting the Pepco qualified individual and an oil spill clean-up contractor. This plan\\nlisted the criteria for notification of local response agencies as (cid:147)fire, explosion, personal\\ninjury or release or significant threat of release off-site.(cid:148) Local response agencies were not\\nnotified. The ST Services assistant terminal manager called Piney Point to summon ST\\nServices  employees  to  assist  at  Chalk  Point.  (See  appendix B  for  a  timeline  indicating\\nsignificant developments as the leak occurred and was identified.)\\n\\nThe Pepco qualified individual called the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for\\noperations  back  and  reported  that  the  pipeline  patrol  flight  had  found  an  oil  spill.  The\\nPepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations then notified the Chalk Point control\\nroom of the pipeline release.\\n\\nThe  Pepco  Chalk  Point  general  supervisor  for  operations  sent  the  Pepco  Chalk\\nPoint shift supervisor to the pipeline crossing at Swanson Creek to assess the situation.\\nDuring this period, the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations reviewed the\\nthree  Pepco  spill  response  plans  for  the  area  to  ensure  that  all  emergency  response\\nrequirements were being met.10 Because each plan had a somewhat different purpose and\\nfocus and the general supervisor for operations  did  not  know  the  exact  location  of  the\\n(underground) spill, he did not know which plan applied to this accident. Consequently, he\\nattempted to notify all response personnel identified in all three plans.\\n\\n9 As  indicated  under  49 Code  of  Federal  Regulations  (CFR) Part  194,  the  qualified  individual  is  a\\ncompany representative available on a 24-hour basis with full authority to: activate personnel and contract\\nwith  required  oil  spill  removal  organization(s);  activate  personnel  and  equipment  maintained  by  the\\noperator; act as liaison with the on-scene coordinator; and obligate funds needed to carry out all required or\\ndirected oil response activities.\\n\\n10 The three plans were 1) the Pepco Oil Spill Emergency Response Plan for the Ryceville Pumping\\nStation  and  Pipeline,  2)  the  Pepco  Oil  Spill  Emergency  Response  Plan  for  the  Chalk  Point  Generating\\nStation,  and  3)  the  Pepco  Spill  Prevention,  Control,  and  Emergency  Response  Plan  for  the  Chalk  Point\\nGenerating Station.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n11\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAbout 1817, the Pepco Chalk Point shift supervisor called the Pepco Chalk Point\\ngeneral supervisor for operations and reported that he would deploy an oil spill boom to\\ncontain the oil in Swanson Creek.\\n\\nAt 1822, the ST Services assistant terminal manager asked the Pepco Chalk Point\\ncontrol room operations supervisor to notify Federal and State agencies about the release,\\nas required by the oil spill response plan for the Chalk Point Generating Station. About\\n1827,  the  Pepco  Chalk  Point  general  supervisor  for  operations  called  the  headquarters\\nPepco senior environmental coordinator at home and discussed the oil spill, so that the\\nPepco senior environmental coordinator could notify the National Response Center.11\\n\\nBetween 1830 and 1835, the Pepco qualified individual met the Pepco Chalk Point\\nshift supervisor (who had been to the leak site) at the Chalk Point plant building and asked\\nthe  shift  supervisor  how  much  oil  had  spilled.  When  the  Pepco  Chalk  Point  shift\\nsupervisor responded that he was not sure, the Pepco qualified individual pressed him for\\nsome number because, he said, he believed that he would have to report a spill quantity\\nwhen  he  called  the  responsible  authorities.  The  Pepco  qualified  individual  stated  that,\\nwhen pressed, the Pepco Chalk Point shift supervisor said, (cid:147)1,000 gallons, 2,000 gallons,\\n[expletive] mess; tell them what you want.(cid:148)\\n\\nThey reported together to the office of the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor\\nfor operations about 1835, during his continuing telephone conversation with the Pepco\\nsenior environmental coordinator. The Pepco qualified individual told the Pepco Chalk\\nPoint general supervisor for operations that the estimated size of the spill was 1,000 to\\n2,000 gallons.  The  Pepco  senior  environmental  coordinator  later  told  investigators  that\\nduring  their  phone  conversation,  he  and  the  Pepco  Chalk  Point  general  supervisor  for\\noperations  discussed  that  the  (cid:147)best  guess(cid:148)  estimate  of  the  release  was  1,000  to\\n2,000 gallons.  He  stated  that  he  and  the  Pepco  Chalk  Point  general  supervisor  for\\noperations agreed to report a release of 2,000 gallons to the National Response Center.\\nThe  Pepco  senior  environmental  coordinator  stated  that  the  Pepco  Chalk  Point  general\\nsupervisor for operations did not discuss the ST Services tank level readings with him.\\n\\nShortly  thereafter,  the  Pepco  senior  environmental  coordinator  called  the  Pepco\\nqualified  individual  for  more  information  about  the  release.  The  Pepco  qualified\\nindividual confirmed the oil spill location and stated that booms were being placed in the\\nwetlands. Based on the information they had, the Pepco senior environmental coordinator\\nand  the  Pepco  qualified  individual  decided  to  report  the  estimated  spill  volume  as\\n2,000 gallons. They agreed to split the reporting task, with the Pepco senior environmental\\ncoordinator reporting to the National Response Center and the Pepco qualified individual\\nreporting to the Maryland Department of the Environment.\\n\\n11 The National Response Center serves as the communications hub of the National Response System,\\nwhich is the Federal Government(cid:146)s mechanism for providing emergency responses to discharges of oil and\\nreleases of chemicals. The National Response Center receives reports of all reportable oil and hazardous\\nsubstance  releases  anywhere  in  the  United  States  and  its  territories.  The  National  Response  Center  then\\ndistributes  incident  reports  to  predetermined  Government  agencies  based  on  National  Response  Center\\nincident classification guidelines.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n12\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAround 1840, the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations received a\\ncall  from  the  ST  Services  assistant  terminal  manager,  who  advised  him  that  the  ST\\nServices  tank  level  readings  were  3,000 barrels  (126,000 gallons)  short,  that  the  spill\\ncovered 3 to 4 acres in the wetlands at Swanson Creek, and that he had activated an oil\\nspill  contractor.  He  also  said  that  ST  Services  personnel  would  be  arriving  in  about\\n15 minutes to close the pipeline valve between Swanson Creek and the Ryceville Station.\\nThe notes made by the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations at this time\\nrecorded the figure of (cid:147)3,000 barrels(cid:148) and that a 3- to 4-acre area was affected by the\\nrelease.\\n\\nAt  1845,  the  Pepco  qualified individual  called  the  Maryland  Department  of  the\\nEnvironment  to  report  the  release.  At  1850,  the  Pepco  qualified  individual  called  the\\nPepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations and told him that he had reported a\\n2,000-gallon release to the Maryland Department of the Environment.\\n\\nAbout  1850,  the  Pepco  senior  environmental  coordinator  called  the  National\\nResponse Center and reported a 2,000-gallon No. 2 fuel oil release from a pipeline at the\\nPepco Chalk Point Generating Station, on the border of the facility property where the\\npipeline crosses Swanson Creek. The Pepco senior environmental coordinator stated that\\nhe understood from people at the plant that most or all of the release was in the creek. The\\nPepco senior environmental coordinator also reported that the incident was discovered at\\n1817 on Friday, April 7, and that a clean up and an investigation into the cause of the\\naccident  were  underway.  The  Pepco  senior  environmental  coordinator  indicated  that\\nPepco had booms in the creek, that materials to absorb oil were being used, and that clean-\\nup contractors had been activated. He reported that he was not aware of any injuries or\\nevacuations.  The  National  Response  Center  watch  officer  designated  the  release\\nnotification as Incident Report No. 525411 and, lacking information on the exact source of\\nthe leak, inaccurately classified it as a fixed (power plant) facility incident rather than a\\npipeline-type  incident.  The  National  Response  Center  officer  sent  notifications  to  the\\nagencies on the fixed facility distribution list.12 Following the Pepco senior environmental\\ncoordinator(cid:146)s notification of the National Response Center, the Pepco qualified individual\\nnotified the U.S. Coast Guard Marine Safety Office in Baltimore, Maryland.\\n\\nBy 1850, the Pepco spill response teams had completed the initial deployment of\\nmore than 1 mile of floating boom in the wetland area on the north side of Swanson Creek\\nand at the mouth of Swanson Creek on the Patuxent River.\\n\\nAbout  1911,  the  National  Response  Center  notified  Environmental  Protection\\nAgency (EPA) Region III (Philadelphia) of the accident by fax.13 About 1930, the on-call\\nEPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator for Region III contacted the Prince George(cid:146)s County\\nFire Department requesting directions to the site and was advised that Prince George(cid:146)s\\nCounty had not been notified of the spill.\\n\\n12 The National Response Center maintains a number of distribution lists. The Office of Pipeline Safety\\n\\nwas on the pipeline accident distribution list but not the fixed facility accident distribution list.\\n\\n13 The EPA responds to spills in the inland areas of the United States, and the Coast Guard responds to\\n\\nspills in U.S. coastal and inland waterways.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n13\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nThe EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator contacted the Pepco senior environmental\\ncoordinator and advised him to call the Prince George(cid:146)s County Communication Center\\nand provide the spill information. The Pepco senior environmental coordinator contacted\\nthe  Prince  George(cid:146)s  County  Communications  Center  and  advised  the  center  that\\n(cid:147)2,000 gallons of No. 2 fuel oil was released and county fire response was not necessary.(cid:148)\\nThe communications center informed the county(cid:146)s hazardous materials coordinator about\\nthe  spill,  and  the  hazardous  materials  coordinator  arrived  at  the  accident  site  within\\n15 minutes to assess the situation.\\n\\nAbout  2015,  the  Pepco  qualified  individual  stated  that  when  he  returned  to  the\\nChalk  Point  command  center,  he  learned  from  the  information  blackboard  that  the\\nestimated spill volume was 3,000 barrels (126,000 gallons), rather than 2,000 gallons. The\\nPepco  qualified  individual  stated  that  he  advised  Maryland  Department  of  the\\nEnvironment and Coast Guard representatives, following their arrival on the scene about\\n2030,  that  the  spill  was  (cid:147)closer  to  3,000 barrels  in  quantity.(cid:148)  Shortly  afterwards,  this\\ninformation  was  relayed  to  the  Coast  Guard  Baltimore  office  and  the  State  emergency\\nresponse  duty  officer.  At  2035,  the  responders  from  the  Maryland  Department  of  the\\nEnvironment  called  their  emergency  response  duty  officer  and  advised  him  that  the\\nupdated release amount was 3,000 barrels.\\n\\nBetween  2030  and  2100,  outside  response  personnel  (including  spill  response\\ncontractors, key Pepco responders, and State and Federal personnel) began arriving with\\nadditional boom and boom deployment boats to augment those that Pepco already had at\\nthe site. Around 2050, ST Services and other contractors working under Pepco(cid:146)s direction\\nbegan evacuating oil from the pipeline between the closed No. 1 river pit valve and the\\nChalk Point Pump Station.\\n\\nShortly  after  2100,  members  of  Pepco(cid:146)s  engineering  and  maintenance  services\\ngroup  confirmed  a  3,000-barrel  release,  based  on  calculations  using  the  tank  level\\nreadings that ST Services used. The Pepco senior environmental coordinator stated that,\\nwhen  he  arrived  at  the  Chalk  Point  command  center  about  2130,  he  learned  from  the\\ninformation  blackboard  that  the  release  volume  was  estimated  to  be  3,000 barrels\\n(126,000 gallons). The Pepco senior environmental coordinator stated that even though he\\nhad  notified  several  agencies  earlier  of  the  2,000-gallon  amount,  he  did  not  revise  the\\n2,000-gallon notification because he believed representatives of all the agencies he had\\nnotified were on-scene or in contact with each other.\\n\\nAround  2300,  Pepco  conducted  a  command  post  briefing,  during  which\\nparticipants reviewed the boom placement and the need to augment the boom Pepco had\\nalready deployed to contain the oil. They agreed for the night to place booms to direct the\\noil to a point accessible to a vacuum truck. The command post briefing also covered plans\\nfor  deploying  additional  boom  at  0600  on  April 8,  before  the  anticipated  tide  change.\\nDuring the remainder of the night, Coast Guard Baltimore office representatives and the\\nMaryland Department of the Environment on-scene coordinator worked with Pepco and\\nits spill response contractors to contain the spill and prepare collection efforts.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n14\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nApril 8. Shortly after 0115, a member of the Prince George(cid:146)s County Hazardous\\nMaterials  Team  contacted  the  National  Response  Center  watch  officer  and  advised  the\\nwatch officer to update the Coast Guard Baltimore office about the accident status. He\\nalso asked the watch officer whether the Chalk Point event constituted a transportation-\\nrelated incident requiring notification of the U.S. Department of Transportation(cid:146)s Office of\\nPipeline Safety. Subsequently, the National Response Center determined that the accident\\nwas a pipeline incident rather than a fixed facility incident and distributed the original\\nincident report, containing the 2,000-gallon spill estimate, to its pipeline notification list,\\nincluding the Office of Pipeline Safety and the Safety Board.\\n\\nAround  0250,  the  Coast  Guard  Federal  on-scene  representative  arrived  at  the\\naccident  site  to  coordinate  Federal,  State,  and  local  efforts.  The  Coast  Guard\\nrepresentative provided Pepco with a copy of the Baltimore Area Contingency Plan and\\ndiscussed  with  Pepco  representatives \\nthe  possibility  of  pre-staging  booms  at\\nenvironmentally  sensitive  creeks  identified  under  the  area  contingency  plan.  After\\nassessing  the  spill  location,  the  Coast  Guard  representative  notified  the  Coast  Guard\\nBaltimore office that the spill was located above the Benedict Bridge on Highway 231.\\nAccording  to  the  Baltimore  Area  Contingency  Plan,  Benedict  Bridge  marks  the\\njurisdictional  dividing  line  between  the  Coast  Guard  Baltimore  office  and  the  EPA(cid:146)s\\nRegion III. Had the spill passed under Benedict Bridge, it would have been considered\\nwithin the Coast Guard(cid:146)s geographic jurisdiction.\\n\\nAround 0330, the Coast Guard Baltimore office notified EPA Region III that the\\nspill  was  in  the  EPA(cid:146)s  geographic  jurisdiction  and  that  Coast  Guard  personnel  were\\nresponding. Several hours later, when the Coast Guard representative on-scene was able to\\nview the wetlands area in daylight, he updated the Coast Guard Baltimore office. Shortly\\nafter  0530,  the  Coast  Guard  Baltimore  office  advised  the  EPA  Federal  On-Scene\\nCoordinator that although the Coast Guard had personnel on the scene, the EPA should\\ntake  the  lead  for  the  spill,  because  the  spill  was  contained  in  the  wetlands  and  it  had\\nsignificantly contaminated the wetlands area, including the local wildlife, with oil.\\n\\nShortly  after  0600,  the  EPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  deployed  from\\nPhiladelphia with an EPA technical support contractor. Around 1015, the EPA Federal On-\\nScene Coordinator arrived at the site and assumed responsibility from the Coast Guard for\\ndirecting the clean-up activity. Soon afterwards, the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator\\nlearned for the first time that the quantity of oil released was actually 3,000 barrels, rather\\nthan 2,000 gallons, of a mixture of No. 2 and No. 6 fuel oil. About 1100, the EPA Federal\\nOn-Scene  Coordinator  held  an  organizational  meeting  with  representatives  of  all  the\\nparties,  including  Pepco,  Pepco(cid:146)s  three  spill  response  contractors,14  the  Maryland\\nDepartment of the Environment, the Coast Guard, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\\nAt the meeting, those attending agreed that:\\n\\n14 The  contractors  were  A&A  Environmental  Services,  Wood  Chuck  Enterprise,  and  Clean  Harbors\\n\\n(standby contactor).\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n15\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\n(cid:149) The  Unified  Command  (the  EPA, \\n\\nthe  Maryland  Department  of  the\\nEnvironment,  and  Pepco)  would  direct  the  management  of  the  response\\neffort.15\\n\\n(cid:149) The  responders  would  continue  with  the  existing  boom  placement.  The\\ncontainment and clean-up efforts appeared to be effective, and there was no\\napparent threat to public health.\\n\\n(cid:149) Because  of  the  large  amount  of  free  product  in  the  wetlands,  the  primary\\nemphasis should be on collection of oil in advance of a storm expected by early\\nevening.\\n\\n(cid:149) With the spill contained in the wetlands, the Unified Command would release\\n\\nthe standby contractor, Clean Harbors.\\n\\nThe weather forecasts changed throughout the afternoon. Earlier forecasts tended\\nto indicate the approach of a relatively weak storm, but the weather reports became more\\nthreatening as the day progressed. Around 1600, and with the expected approach of severe\\nwinds  and  heavy  rains,  the  EPA  and  the  Maryland  Department  of  the  Environment\\nsurveyed  Pepco(cid:146)s  site  response  activities  and  revised  the  storm  plan  so  that  additional\\ncollection resources were placed at the secondary containment points and outer booms.\\n\\nDuring  the  early  stages  of  the  response,  Pepco  deployed  about  300  of  its  own\\nemployees  and  spill  response  contractors  to  assist  with  the  oil  recovery  efforts.  (See\\nfigure 6.) Pepco response personnel were on rotating 8-hour shifts. The EPA Federal On-\\nScene Coordinator noted that those coming on shift typically were not briefed before or\\nafter  arriving  at  the  scene.  Little  information  was  shared  between  shifts  of  employees.\\nPepco  response  officials  stated  that  they  often  were  not  included  in  the  meetings\\nconducted by the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator. In some cases, they could not attend\\nsuch meetings because it was physically impossible; the space provided for the meetings\\nwas inadequate to accommodate all those wishing to attend. Pepco indicated that because\\nof these problems with the meetings, some of the orders of the Unified Command were not\\nclearly communicated to its personnel.16 At the same time, some meeting attendees were\\nnot essential to the response effort.\\n\\n15 A Unified Command  is an element  within the Incident  Command System that  represents  the  key\\norganizations  responding  to  the  incident.  Under  the  National  Contingency  Plan,  the  Unified  Command\\ntypically  consists  of  the  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator,  the  State  on-scene  coordinator,  and  the  incident\\ncommander of the responsible party.\\n\\n16 From a letter, dated August 3, 2000, from Pepco(cid:146)s incident commander for the Chalk Point response\\nto the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator for the response concerning lessons learned from the emergency\\nresponse to the Chalk Point oil spill.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n16\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nBecause Pepco(cid:146)s qualified individual changed with every 8-hour shift, the Pepco\\nqualified individual did not provide continuity of response and often had to check with\\nother Pepco officials before providing assistance requested by the EPA Federal On-Scene\\nCoordinator.  In  her  postaccident  description  of  events,  the  EPA  Federal  On-Scene\\nCoordinator cited the frequent changing of Pepco(cid:146)s qualified individual and stated that it\\nled to (cid:147)episodes of miscommunication and unclear lines of authority during the initial key\\ndates of the response.(cid:148)17\\n\\nFigure 6. Response personnel working on wooden mats in the marsh.\\n\\nDuring  the  first  24 hours  of  the  spill  response,  three  sets  of  booms  had  been\\ndeployed, and the oil spill was contained in about 5 acres of wetlands. However, during\\nthe evening of April 8, the weather deteriorated, and conditions included winds in excess\\nof 50 mph and strong rain showers. Because of the heavy rains and high wind gusts, the\\nouter  booms  were  breached  about  2030,  releasing  a  significant  amount  of  oil  into  the\\nPatuxent River. (See figure 7 for an aerial photo of two plumes of oil in Swanson Creek,\\nmoving toward the Patuxent River.) During the night, Pepco(cid:146)s spill response contractors\\nattempted to deploy additional personnel and equipment, but the weather made it unsafe\\nfor workers to be in the wetlands area or on the river, so they could not be deployed.

The  efforts  were  unsuccessful  until  the  Unified  Command  1)\\nobtained additional personnel to implement an Incident Command System structure on\\nApril 11, and 2) obtained additional marine response equipment for oil recovery. Between\\nApril 8  and  12,  the  oil  plume  spread  approximately  17 miles  (linear)  downstream,\\naffecting approximately 40 miles of shoreline, including several environmentally sensitive\\nand populated creeks in Calvert and St. Mary(cid:146)s Counties. (See figure 8 for creek boom\\nlocations and spread of spill.) The major events that took place during the response to the\\noil(cid:146)s escape from containment are provided below.\\n\\nApril 9. In the early daylight hours of April 9, an oil plume was observed traveling\\nin a straight line from the mouth of Swanson Creek across the Patuxent River towards\\nCalvert County. At 0745, the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator contacted the Baltimore\\noffice of the Coast Guard to state that the containment had failed and to ask the Coast\\nGuard to identify potential Federal resources with marine capabilities. The Coast Guard\\ndirected the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator to several possible sources of assistance\\n(Patuxent Naval Air Base, etc.) in the vicinity. Shortly thereafter, Pepco informed the EPA\\nFederal  On-Scene  Coordinator  that  it  was  having  difficulty  obtaining  the  necessary\\ncontractor resources with marine capabilities, particularly the waterborne skimmers and\\nskimming vessels needed to respond effectively.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n18\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nCHARLES\\nCOUNTY\\n\\nPRINCE\\n\\nGEORGE\\xe2\\x80\\x99S \\n\\nCOUNTY\\n\\nHunting Creek\\n\\nChalk Point\\n\\nSpill\\nSpill\\nSite\\nSite\\n\\nTrent Hall \\n\\nCreek\\n\\nWashington \\n\\nCreek\\n\\nS w anson Creek\\n\\nI n d i an Creek\\n\\n5\\n\\n235\\n\\n6\\n\\nST.

The effort was unsuccessful.\\n\\nBy mid-afternoon, the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator, other EPA officials on\\nthe scene, the Maryland Department of the Environment on-scene coordinator, and a U.S.\\nDepartment of the Interior representative had met and agreed that the spill represented a\\nsubstantial threat to public health and the environment. As a result, the EPA contracted\\nwith the Marine Spill Response Corporation, an environmental spill response contractor,\\nto provide on-water response services and personnel.18\\n\\nAt 2100, another meeting was held, during which the protective booming of the\\nenvironmentally sensitive Hunting, Indian, and Trent Hall Creeks, all of which fed into the\\nPatuxent River, was given a high priority. As a result, it was decided to continue contractor\\nresponse efforts through the night.\\n\\nApril 10.

In recognition of the problems, at 1430, the EPA Federal\\nOn-Scene  Coordinator  asked  Coast  Guard  on-site  personnel  to  develop  an  Incident\\nCommand System structure for the response, under her direction. About the same time,\\nthe  EPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  strongly  advised  Pepco  that  it  had  to  greatly\\nincrease its logistical support for and control over the response contractors and that a spill\\nmanagement contractor was needed.\\n\\nAt  the  2100  staff  meeting,  the  EPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  stressed  the\\nneed to  deploy  protective boom around the creeks.  She  directed  Pepco  to  immediately\\ndeploy  protective  booms  at Hunting,  Indian,  and  Trent  Hall  Creeks.  At  2200,  the  EPA\\nFederal On-Scene Coordinator requested that the Coast Guard provide 25 employees by\\n0600  on  April 11  to  staff  the  Incident  Command  System  structure  that  was  being\\ndeveloped.\\n\\nApril 11. By 0300, the booming of the creeks had not been completed. The EPA\\nFederal On-Scene Coordinator again directed Pepco to protectively boom the creeks. At\\n0715, an overflight of the affected area showed that no boom had been installed to protect\\nthe creeks and that Trent Hall and Indian Creeks both showed evidence of significant oil\\ncontamination.\\n\\nAt the 0900 meeting, Pepco indicated that it was attempting to bring additional\\ncontractor resources to the scene. The EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator, in recognition\\nof the (cid:147)continued failure of the Pepco contractors to carry out direction from the Unified\\nCommand,(cid:148)19  began  preparing  to  have  additional  Federal  environmental  responders\\nparticipate in the Incident Command System structure.\\n\\nThe Coast Guard Captain of the Port of Baltimore arrived on the scene about 1100,\\nwith additional personnel to staff the Incident Command System structure that had been\\ndeveloped since the previous day. Organizational functions were split into four sections(cid:151)\\noperations,  planning,  logistics,  and  finance(cid:151)and  Unified  Command  officials  managed\\neach section. All field operations were carried out under the direction of the operations\\nsection. The newly arriving Coast Guard personnel were designated to monitor the field\\noperations being conducted by Pepco(cid:146)s contractors to ensure that work was completed in a\\ntimely and efficient fashion.\\n\\nThe  EPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  again  asked  Pepco  to  hire  a  spill\\nmanagement team to manage its contractors and the spill response.

At  this  location,  the  pipeline  was  on  Pepco\\nproperty  and  passed  through  wetlands  adjacent  to  Swanson  Creek,  a  tributary  to  the\\nPatuxent River. The release point was 127 feet north of valve pit No. 1 on Pepco property.\\n\\nThe pipe at the failure area was 12 3/4-inch-diameter, 0.203-inch wall thickness,\\nAmerican  Petroleum  Institute  (API) 5L  grade  X42  electric  resistance  weld  steel  pipe,\\ninstalled with 1-inch polyurethane thermal insulation and a 170-mill polyethylene jacket\\nexterior coating. The pipe was insulated and coated before the field bend at this location\\nwas made during the pipeline(cid:146)s installation.\\n\\nThe pipeline was buried about 3 1/2 feet deep at the rupture location. The rupture\\narea  was  excavated  a  few  days  after  the  failure.  When  the  pipeline  was  exposed,  the\\nprofile of a buckle could be seen through the pipe coating. (See figure 9.) When the pipe\\ncoating was removed, a crack in the circumferential direction was visible.\\n\\nIn a postaccident communication from Pepco to Safety Board staff, Pepco stated it\\nhad reviewed the recorded pressure information, the size of the pipeline crack, and the\\npipeline operating conditions at the time of the accident and determined that, to release the\\nestimated 129,000 gallons of product spilled, the pipe failure had to have occurred at least\\n5 hours  before  the  Chalk  Point  pump  began  cavitating  at  1430  on  April 7,  2000.  A\\nsubsequent  communication  from  Mirant  (current  operator  of  the  pipeline)20  to  Safety\\nBoard staff noted that the failure had probably occurred during the startup of the Chalk\\n\\n20 Pepco sold the Piney Point Oil Pipeline and the Chalk Point Generating Station in December 2000.\\n\\nMirant subsequently became the pipeline owner and operator.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n22\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nPoint pump, about 0715, when pipeline pressure was at its highest.

Indication of the buckle (Arrows show buckle location).\\n\\nTests and Research\\n\\nA  53-inch-long  section  of  pipeline  taken  from  the  scene  was  examined  at  the\\nSafety Board laboratory. The pipe was bent and contained an outward-protruding buckle\\non the inside radius of the bend. The angle of the bend in which the buckle was formed\\nwas determined to be in the 5- to 6-degree range. The buckle extended around 270 degrees\\nof the pipe circumference, from approximately the 10 o(cid:146)clock to the 7 o(cid:146)clock position.\\n(See figure 10.) The pipe was deformed into a slightly elliptical shape. The buckle area\\ncontained an open crack at the crown of the buckle, which extended from approximately\\nthe  2 o(cid:146)clock  to  the  4 o(cid:146)clock  position.  The  maximum  height  of  the  buckle  was\\napproximately 1 inch at the 3 o(cid:146)clock position on the inside of the bend. The crack was\\n6 1/2-inches  long  by  3/8-inch  wide  at  its  widest  portion.  (See  figure 11.)  No  external\\ncorrosion was noted on the pipe section when it was examined under a microscope.\\n\\nThe interior surface of the pipe in the area of the buckle peak contained a number\\nof shallow secondary cracks. All the cracks were circumferentially oriented, confined to\\nthe permanently deformed area of the pipe (approximately 1/4 inch from the buckle apex),\\nhad blunt tips, and were filled with corrosion products. Some of these cracks exhibited\\nslight branching. The appearance of these cracks was typical of corrosion fatigue cracking\\nin low carbon steels, resulting from exposure to high stress amplitudes.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n23\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFigure 10.

Fracture surface profile of failure.\\n\\nPiney Point Oil Pipeline\\n\\nPipeline Information\\n\\nThe Piney Point Oil Pipeline was constructed for the Steuart Petroleum Company\\nin 1971 and 1972 and put in service in 1973. Pepco purchased the pipeline in 1976. In\\n1995, ST Services purchased the Piney Point Terminal facility from Steuart Petroleum,\\nand ST Services operated the pipeline for Pepco with former Steuart Petroleum personnel.\\n\\nFuel  oil  was  delivered  to  the  Piney  Point  Terminal  by  marine  vessels  and  then\\ntransported from the terminal by the Piney Point Oil Pipeline. The 51.5-mile-long pipeline\\nsystem was composed of 12-inch and 16-inch-diameter pipeline segments that were used\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n25\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nto transport heated fuel oil from the Piney Point Terminal, via the intermediate Ryceville\\nStation, to generating stations at Chalk Point and Morgantown. The pipeline segment from\\nRyceville to Chalk Point was approximately 11 miles long. The oil was heated to make it\\nflow more easily, and the system operated up to approximately 160(cid:176) F.\\n\\n1995 In-line Inspection. The Ryceville to Chalk Point segment of the Piney Point\\nOil Pipeline was internally inspected in November 1995 with a geometry tool and an in-\\nline magnetic flux leakage tool. After receiving the inspection reports in January 1996,\\nPepco exposed the pipeline and examined corrosion anomalies at 29 locations in spring\\n1996.  The  data  from  the  magnetic  flux  inspection  did  not  correlate  well  with  field\\nmeasurements for either wall loss data or odometer readings. Pepco(cid:146)s Pipeline Working\\nGroup  recommended  that  an  additional  in-line  inspection  be  conducted  in  1997  using\\nultrasonic inspection tool technology.\\n\\n1997 Pipetronix In-line Inspection. Pepco contracted with the ultrasonic in-line\\ninspection contractor Pipetronix21 to conduct a pipeline inspection on August 16, 1997.\\nBefore conducting its ultrasonic inspection tool survey, Pipetronix subcontracted for an in-\\nline caliper tool22 survey, which was completed on August 11, 1997. Pipetronix had the\\ncaliper tool run to confirm that there were no physical obstructions in the pipeline that\\nwould prevent passage of the ultrasonic inspection tool.\\n\\nOn  August 16,  1997,  Pipetronix  examined  the  segment  of  the  Piney  Point  Oil\\nPipeline from Ryceville to Chalk Point with an ultrasonic inspection tool. Pepco required\\nthat Pipetronix prepare a final report for the inspection that would include a complete,\\nwritten survey report for the pipeline. The report would provide the pipeline operator data,\\nincluding  all  types  of  corrosion,  gouging,  pipeline  fittings  (such  as  T-pieces,23  valves,\\netc.),  girth  welds,  wall  thickness  changes,  special  features  (such  as  externally  welded\\npatches,  insulating  flanges,  etc.),  and  differentiation  between  internal  and  external\\ncorrosion (for general surface corrosion, pitting, and channeling).24\\n\\nAccording to the contract, Pipetronix was to use a multi-step process to identify\\n\\nand interpret each feature in the pipeline, as follows:\\n\\n1. Field check of the data at random locations immediately after the tool run is\\n\\ncompleted,\\n\\n2. Search of the data by automatic computer programs to detect girth welds, pipe\\n\\ninstallations, defects (internal and external), markers, and other features,\\n\\n21 On  November 25,  1999,  Pipeline  Integrity  International  Ltd.  acquired  the  Pipetronix  Group.  The\\nsubsidiary  PII  North  America,  Inc.,  now  controls  those  assets  that  belonged  to  Pipetronix  in  the  United\\nStates.\\n\\n22 A caliper tool is an in-line inspection device used to determine the geometrical condition of the pipe,\\n\\nincluding the size and location of abnormalities.\\n\\n23 A T-piece is normally a tee pipe-fitting welded into a pipeline, although alternatively, a T-piece may\\n\\nbe made by welding a pipe stub to a pipeline and drilling a hole into the pipeline.\\n\\n24 National  Association  of  Corrosion  Engineers  Standard  RP0102-2002,  Recommended  Practice  In-\\n\\nLine Inspection of Pipelines, table 1, lists the types of in-line inspection tools and inspection purposes.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n26\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\n3. Computer generation, with relevant input from the interpreter, of a features list,\\n4.\\n\\nInterpretation by the interpreter of each feature found in the search phase.\\n\\nThe completed pipeline features list was to contain all features recorded in the tool\\nrun and present the results of the interpretation in condensed form. The report noted that\\ndata  collected  during  the  tool  run  were  systematically  evaluated  according  to  criteria\\ndefined  in  the  contract  between  Pipetronix  and  Pepco.  Pipetronix  performed  this\\nevaluation in five phases:\\n\\n(cid:149)\\n\\n(cid:149)\\n(cid:149)\\n\\n(cid:149)\\n\\n(cid:149)\\n\\nPhase  1:  Handover  of  data  from  the  workshop  (integration  within  the\\nmanagement of the department, handover meeting, familiarizing of the project\\nleader);\\nPhase 2: Preparation of the interpretation;\\nPhase 3: Main interpretation (automatic interpretation, manual interpretation,\\nfeature list editing, quality check);\\nPhase 4: Summarizing of the results (handover of the features list to the client,\\ndiscussion  of  the  results  for  the  final  report,  documenting  of  the  features,\\ncompletion of the final report, quality check);\\nPhase 5: Project completion, including forwarding the final report to Pepco.\\n\\nAfter the August 1997 Pipetronix inspection, the pipeline segment from Ryceville\\nto Chalk Point was excavated and exposed in 12 places in fall 1997. The pipeline was\\ninspected  and  repaired  at  locations  indicated  by  the  ultrasonic  inspection  to  have  the\\ndeepest  and  most  severe  corrosion.  At  these  locations,  Pepco  determined  that  the\\nPipetronix in-line inspection data correlated relatively well with the field measurements\\nmade of the pipe-wall thickness using an ultrasonic testing instrument. However, Pepco\\nfound  that  some  locations  had  more  severe  corrosion  than  had  been  indicated  by  the\\nultrasonic inspection.\\n\\nPipetronix provided the results of the inspection of the Ryceville to Chalk Point\\nsegment of pipeline to Pepco in a final report dated January 20, 1998. The final report\\nincluded  general  information  about  the  ultrasonic  inspection  tool  used,  the  ultrasonic\\nmeasuring  method,  the  design  of  the  tool,  the  benefits  and  limitations  of  the  tool,  the\\nsurvey procedures, the procedures for evaluating the collected data, and a detailed table of\\npipeline features.\\n\\nPipetronix(cid:146)s interpretation of the tool data was included in an appendix to the final\\nreport entitled (cid:147)Features List.(cid:148) The report identified and located by station number various\\npipeline features, including external metal loss, internal metal loss, laminations, flanges,\\nfield bends, weld-o-lets, hot bends, dents, sleeves, markers, girth welds, valves, and T-\\npieces.  Pepco  used  Pipetronix(cid:146)s  in-line  inspection  report  to  establish  the  baseline\\nconditions of the pipeline and to conduct its excavation and field inspection program.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n27\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nExcluding  various  aboveground  features  at  the  pig  launcher  and  receiver,  the\\nPipetronix  features  list  identified  three  T-pieces  in  the  pipeline.  Two  T-pieces  were\\napproximately 1,519 feet apart, one on each side of Swanson Creek, at odometer stations\\n51887.20 and 53406.10. The third identified T-piece, which was actually the buckle that\\nfailed on April 7, 2000, was identified as being located at odometer station 53526.55.\\n\\nAfter conducting a postaccident review of the inspection log for the August 1997\\nin-line inspection, Pipetronix determined that its analyst had inaccurately interpreted the\\nlog  indication  at  odometer  station  53526.55  as  a  T-piece.  At  the  time  of  the  in-line\\ninspection, Pipetronix(cid:146)s software reference library did not include a standard image of an\\noutward  protruding  buckle,  such  as  the  one  at  odometer  station  53526.55.  Pipetronix\\nacknowledged  that,  based  on  its  knowledge  at  the  time,  the  feature  should  have  been\\ninterpreted as an (cid:147)unknown.(cid:148)25\\n\\nBefore  the  April 7,  2000,  accident,  Pepco  had  authorized  another  ultrasonic\\npipeline  inspection  to  be  conducted  by  Pipetronix  in  April  2000.  At  the  time  of  the\\naccident, Pepco was cleaning the pipeline to prepare it for this upcoming in-line inspection\\nto take place later in April 2000.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nThe  pipeline  was  operated  manually  for  startup  and  shutdown.26  The  Ryceville\\nStation  was  normally  left  unattended  after  initial  system  startup  when  no  pump  was\\noperating  at  Ryceville.  Pipeline  operating  data  were  not  periodically  transmitted  to  the\\nPiney  Point  Terminal.  The  pipeline  monitoring  system  transmitted  pipeline  pressure,\\ntemperature, and flow rate alarms to Piney Point. The pipeline alarms were displayed on\\nthe  computer  screen  at  the  Piney  Point  Terminal,  and  audible  alarms  alerted  the  ST\\nServices  operator  on  duty \\nthat  were  outside\\npredetermined  limits.  Using  his  computer  terminal,  the  ST  Services  shift  supervisor(cid:146)s\\noperating practice while serving as the pipeline controller was to verify the system alarm\\nstatus, as well as pressure, temperature, and flow rate information, once each 8-hour shift.\\nThe alarm data were stored at each station for 30 days and could be printed locally at each\\nstation if a data review was desired. The pipeline computer monitoring system provided\\nthe operations data it was designed to gather during No. 6 fuel oil transfers.\\n\\nto  pipeline  operating  conditions \\n\\nPepco(cid:146)s  Piney  Point  Oil  Pipeline  Manual  required  that  during  a  No. 6  fuel  oil\\ntransfer,  the  ST  Services  pipeline  controller  had  to  conduct  a  daily  recording  of  meter\\nreadings  and  to  communicate  daily  with  Pepco  operations  personnel  to  ascertain  the\\ndelivered  quantity,  flow  rate,  available  tank  capacity,  and  estimated  time  of  operation\\ncompletion. The Pepco manual further required that the ST Services pipeline controller\\n\\n25 A postaccident Office of Pipeline Safety report that evaluated the 1997 Pipetronix survey found that\\nthe ultrasonic inspection tool provided good characterization of the pipeline(cid:146)s physical elements, such as the\\nvalves,  tees,  bends,  fittings,  and  points  of  deformation.  The  report  also  found  that  the  tool  recorded  an\\nindication  of  a  buckle  at  the  location  of  odometer  station  53526.55,  but  the  Pipetronix  analyst\\nmischaracterized the indication as a T-piece.\\n\\n26 The pipeline was operated on an as-needed basis when a No. 6 fuel oil transfer was required for a\\n\\ngenerating station.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n28\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nrecord the pipeline pressure, temperature, and flow rate at Piney Point at 4-hour intervals\\nduring a No. 6 fuel oil transfer.\\n\\nThe  ST  Services  pipeline  controller  did  not  continuously  monitor  pipeline\\noperating conditions. The ST Services pipeline controller could receive a call from the\\nsystem that a pipeline operating parameter was out of allowable tolerance, and he could\\nthen access the monitoring system to determine the nature of the alarm.\\n\\nPipeline flushing was performed at the end of each No. 6 fuel oil transfer.27 Piping\\nalignments for pigging operations were set up similarly to a flushing operation, although\\nthere were obvious differences in routing the product through the pig traps. The product\\ndid not flow through the meter at the Chalk Point Station during a flushing operation or\\nduring  the  pigging  operation  on  the  day  of  the  accident.  In  addition,  the  meters  and\\npressure-sensing points at the Chalk Point Station were not in the oil flow path, and the\\ntemperature-sensing equipment was not in the direct oil flow path to the Ryceville Station.\\nThe  pipeline  monitoring  system  was  not  capable  of  monitoring  pipeline  operating\\nconditions because of the meter location and the locations of the sensing points. Pipeline\\nshift  supervisors  and  operators  had  no  predetermined  line  balance  limits  to  follow  to\\nassess  pumped  and  delivered  product  volumes  during  flushing  or  pigging  operations.\\nPepco(cid:146)s  Piney  Point  Oil  Pipeline  Manual  did  not  require  any  pipeline  operations\\npersonnel  to  perform  periodic  line  balance  calculations  during  a  flushing  or  pigging\\noperation, nor did they do so.\\n\\nThe  abnormal  operating  condition  procedures  described \\n\\nin  section 7.4,\\nparagraph 5.2,  of  Pepco(cid:146)s  Piney  Point  Oil  Pipeline  Manual  required  the  ST  Services\\nterminal  duty  operator  or  pipeline  operator  mechanic  to  report  any  abnormal  fuel  oil\\nsystem operating condition that was indicated by 1) an alarm condition on the pipeline\\nmonitoring  system,  2)  a  visual  indication  of  a  local  pressure  or  level  indication,  3)  an\\nabnormal  system  operating  indication  from  the  Pepco  generating  station  senior  power\\nplant  operator,  4)  or  the  One-Call  system.  Paragraph 5.3  provides  an  example  of  an\\nabnormal system operating condition, which it termed an:\\n\\nIncrease, decrease or an alarm differential in the fuel oil system pressure or flow\\nrate  outside  of  normal  steady  state  operating  conditions  as  indicated  by  a\\ncomputer monitoring alarm condition or a local pressure instrumentation.\\n\\nPipeline Maps and Records\\n\\nThe original Piney Point Oil Pipeline alignment sheets and as-built drawings were\\ndestroyed in a fire before Pepco purchased the pipeline in 1976. Title 49 CFR 195.404\\nrequires  operators  to  have  maps  and  records  that  include  at  least  the  following\\ninformation: 1) the location and identification of breakout tanks, pump stations, scraper\\nand  sphere  facilities,  pipeline  valves,  cathodically  protected  facilities,  facilities  in  an\\nimmediate response area not equipped to fail safe, facility rights-of-way, and overpressure\\nsafety  devices;  2)  all  crossings  of  public  roads,  railroads,  rivers,  buried  utilities,  and\\n\\n27 Flushing is the process of pumping flushing oil in the reverse direction of normal flow in the pipeline\\n\\nto displace the No. 6 fuel oil from the pipeline before it cools to the point that it cannot be pumped.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n29\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nforeign  pipelines;  3)  the  maximum  operating  pressure  of  each  pipeline;  and  4)  the\\ndiameter,  grade,  type,  and  nominal  wall  thickness  of  all  pipe.  During  1993  and  1994,\\nPepco  had  pipeline  alignment  maps  made  based  on  aerial  photography  and  created\\ndrawings for aboveground piping of Piney Point Oil Pipeline facilities.\\n\\nMeteorological Information\\n\\nAt mid-afternoon, on April 7, 2000, Reagan Washington National Airport (about\\n40 miles  northwest  of  the  accident  scene)  recorded  a  maximum  wind  speed  of  about\\n19 mph.  The  temperature  was  77\\xc2\\xb0 F,  and  the  sky  was  overcast.  By  mid-afternoon  on\\nApril 8, 2000, wind gusts of about 50 mph were recorded at the airport. Conditions were\\nrainy, and the temperature was approximately 57\\xc2\\xb0 F. During the evening of April 8, rains\\nin excess of 1 inch and winds over 50 mph were experienced in the Chalk Point area.\\n\\nPepco Oil Spill Preparedness\\n\\nUnder 49 CFR 194.101, pipeline operators are required to submit a spill response\\nplan  to  the  Research  and  Special  Programs  Administration  (RSPA)  for  review  and\\napproval. Pepco had provided such a plan to RSPA. According to the regulation, the plan\\nmust address a response to a worst-case discharge and the threat from such a discharge. It\\nmust also include procedures for conducting drills, including identifying the types of drills\\nto be conducted and their schedules. Appendix A to Part 194 provides recommendations\\nconcerning the topics that the response plan must address. Under section 7, concerning\\ndrill procedures, it is recommended that drills be conducted on the following topics at the\\nfollowing frequencies:\\n\\n(cid:149) Quarterly  drills  on  emergency  procedures  and  notifications  of  qualified\\n\\nindividuals for manned pipelines;\\n\\n(cid:149) Quarterly  drills  involving  emergency  actions  by  assigned  operating  or\\nmaintenance personnel and notifications of qualified individuals for unmanned\\npipelines;\\n\\n(cid:149) Annual tabletop exercises involving the shore-based management team;\\n(cid:149) A  drill  once  every  3 years  that  exercises  the  entire  response  plan  for  each\\n\\nresponse zone of the pipeline system.\\n\\nIn September 1996, a tabletop exercise was conducted at Chalk Point under the\\ndirection of RSPA(cid:146)s Office of Pipeline Safety, with the participation of the Coast Guard.\\nThe response exercise involved a hypothetical spill at the Pepco Morgantown facility of\\n800 barrels of No. 6 fuel oil into the Wicomico River. This was a coastal inland waterway\\nrelease scenario, within the Coast Guard(cid:146)s jurisdiction. (The EPA did not participate in the\\ndrill.)  The  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety  sponsored  the  tabletop  exercise  to  assess  Pepco(cid:146)s\\npipeline emergency preparedness under the National Preparedness for Response Exercise\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n30\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nProgram and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Specifically, the objectives of the tabletop\\nexercise were to:\\n\\nValidate the emergency response plans and procedures of Pepco, and to enhance\\nparticipants(cid:146)  knowledge  of  the  appropriate  plan  and  procedures  (e.g.  Facility\\nResponse Plan, Area Contingency Plan, State Contingency Plan, etc.)[28]\\n\\nIn  the  review  that  followed  the  exercise,  Pepco  received  the  following\\n\\nrecommendations addressing incident management:\\n\\nThe Pepco FRP [Facility Response Plan] should be revised to reflect how Pepco\\nintends to direct response and resolve spill-related issues jointly with local, state,\\nand  federal  responders.  Additional  training  on  the  roles  and  responsibilities\\ninvolved  in  these  assignments  should  reinforce  the  policies  of  the  oil  spill\\ncontingency  plan.  The  training  should  include  all  potential  response  groups  if\\npossible, to assist each group in clarifying its role in response operations and as a\\npart of the unified system. The SMT [Spill Management Team] should ensure that\\nother Pepco personnel potentially involved in response operations are also trained\\nin their roles. New personnel assignment to perform the functions of the Incident\\nCommand System, revisions of their roles and responsibilities, and a description\\nof how these will interact with the local, state and federal responders in the unified\\nsystem should be reflected in the FRP.[29]\\n\\nAccording  to  Pepco,30  Revision  No. 3  (dated  March 13,  1997)  of  the  Oil  Spill\\nEmergency Response Plan for the Ryceville Pumping Station and Pipeline incorporated\\nthe above comments. On August 26, 1997, Pepco submitted Revision No. 3 of the plan to\\nthe  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety,  which,  on  October 27,  1997,  completed  review  of  the\\nrevised  plan.  The  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety  stated  that  the  revised  plan  adequately\\naddressed the response planning recommendations made by the Office of Pipeline Safety\\nbased on the drill results.\\n\\nBetween  January  1999  and  April 7,  2000,  at  least  five  notification  drills  were\\nconducted for the Piney Point Oil Pipeline.

Review  previous  internal  inspection,  make  needed  repairs,  and  plan  future\\n\\ninspections,\\nImplement operations procedures for line monitoring during pigging activities,\\n\\n3.\\n4. Review and update schematic drawings.\\n\\nPipeline Safety Actions Since Accident\\n\\nSince the accident, Pepco began and Mirant continued (after its purchase of the\\nPiney  Point  Oil  Pipeline)  to  make  improvements  to  comply  with,  and  in  some  cases\\nexceed,  the  Office  of  Pipeline  Safety(cid:146)s  corrective  action  orders.  Mirant  prepared  an\\nintegrity study to assess the risks posed by pipe wrinkles,31 to establish acceptance criteria\\nfor pipe wrinkles, and to remove all those wrinkles or defects not satisfying the acceptance\\ncriteria. Mirant also developed additional pipeline repair procedures. After all inspections\\nand replacements were completed, the entire pipeline system was hydrostatically tested.\\nThe  transport  temperature  for  No. 6  fuel  oil  was  reduced  temporarily  from  160\\xc2\\xb0 F  to\\n125\\xc2\\xb0 F until the influence of heat on pipeline movement could be studied.\\n\\nMirant installed supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems32 with\\nsoftware-based leak detection and radar tank gauges with remote reading capability on all\\nPiney  Point  Oil  Pipeline  tanks,  and  the  entire  set  of  operations  and  maintenance\\nprocedures was rewritten. In support of this pipeline integrity focus, two different smart\\n\\n31 A wrinkle is a smooth wave deflection of the pipe wall and may have a single inward or outward\\n\\ndeflection or may include a sinusoidal waveform with both inward and outward displacements.\\n\\n32 Pipeline  controllers  use  SCADA  systems  to  remotely  monitor  and  control  movement  through\\npipelines.  With  a  SCADA  system,  controllers  can  monitor  flow  rates  and  pressures  along  the  lines  and\\ncontrol valves and pumps to adjust the flow at pump stations and locations throughout the pipeline system.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n32\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\npig technologies (ultrasonic and deformation inertial) were employed to inspect the entire\\npipeline  system  in  May 2001.  Mirant  indicated  that  the  evaluations  were  intended  to\\nprovide  a  substantial  new  baseline  for  maintaining  pipeline  integrity,  in  addition  to\\nrestoring pipeline activities.\\n\\nMirant  has  put  in  place  a  new  diversified  pipeline  management  team  that  has\\nindicated it intends to continue to use industry-recognized pipeline consultants. This team\\nintends to prepare and manage a long-term integrity plan for the pipeline, consistent with\\nthe integrity management rule in Federal pipeline safety regulations. Mirant has employed\\nits own pipeline operating personnel, which, Mirant states, have been trained in the new\\nprocedures and equipment. Mirant has implemented an internal audit process that it says\\nwill provide further assurance that all current regulatory and industry best practices are\\nmaintained.\\n\\nIn  accordance  with  the  requirements  at  49 CFR 194.101,  Mirant  submitted  to\\nRSPA in December 2001 a spill response plan dated May 2001. RSPA approved the plan\\non April 30, 2002. Mirant developed its facility emergency spill response plans with the\\nassistance  of  industry  experts.  During  the  first  6 months  of  2001,  three  revisions  were\\nmade to the Oil Spill Emergency Response Plan for the Ryceville Pumping Station and\\nPipeline. Specifically, these changes addressed ownership and nomenclature adjustments,\\nas well as additional revisions intended to clarify and simplify the plan. On July 27, 2001,\\nMirant  published  Response  Strategies  for  Southern  Maryland.  Based  on  (cid:147)operational\\nexperience gained during the Swanson Creek oil spill response and studies,(cid:148) the manual\\nwas intended to provide tactical response information for use as a pre-planning document\\nfor response managers and crews. The manual identified key control points along and off\\nthe pipeline corridor where response actions might be taken should a release occur. One of\\nthe main elements in the manual was a site summary sheet for each of the primary control\\npoint locations. The summary sheets were prepared with map and chart references with\\nglobal positioning system location data, location and general access instructions, general\\nrelease/flow paths, information concerning receiving water bodies and selected sensitive\\nfeatures,  and  response  protocols  and  tactics.  Shortly  after  the  manual  was  published,\\nMirant personnel met with the members of the Local Emergency Planning Committee,\\nwhich represents the local public response agencies of the four surrounding counties, to\\nfamiliarize them with the implementation of the manual.\\n\\nIn 2001, Mirant conducted 11 drills concerning spill response (2 deployment drills,\\n5 tabletop drills, and 4 qualified individual notification drills). As of June 1, 2002, Mirant\\nhad conducted four spill response drills (one deployment, one tabletop, and two qualified\\nindividual notification) in 2002.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n33\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nOther Information\\n\\nIncident Command System\\n\\nThe Incident Command System concept was developed as a consequence of fires\\nthat destroyed significant environmental assets in 1970 in Southern California. Agencies\\nrecognized that they needed a system that allowed them to work together effectively and\\nefficiently  when  conducting  responses  to  the  broadest  range  of  emergencies,  including\\nincidents involving threats to lives, property, and the environment. A multi-agency task\\nforce subsequently developed the Incident Command System.\\n\\nThe system consists of procedures for controlling personnel, facilities, equipment,\\nand communications during an incident response. It is designed to be used from the time\\nan  incident  occurs  until  response  operations  are  completed.  The  Incident  Command\\nSystem  structure  has  five  major  functional  areas(cid:151)command,  operations,  planning,\\nlogistics,  and  finance(cid:151)but  the  structure  is  flexible  and  can  be  accommodated  to  the\\nspecific  needs  of  each  response.  Consequently,  it  can  be  used  for  any  type  or  size  of\\nincident. It provides a framework under which agencies may communicate and function\\nusing uniform terminology and operating procedures.\\n\\nThe  system  is  widely  used  by  Federal,  State,  and  local  responders.  Since  the\\ndevelopment  of  the  Incident  Command  System  concept,  Incident  Command  System\\nstructures have been used at hundreds of incidents with general success. In February 1996,\\nthe Coast Guard officially adopted the National Interagency Incident Management System\\nIncident Command System and has developed various training modules for it.\\n\\nIn  an  April 24,  2001,  letter  to  the  Safety  Board,  the  EPA  Federal  On-Scene\\n\\nCoordinator for the Chalk Point accident stated that:\\n\\nEPA  currently  has  no  formal  policy  on  the  use  of  Incident  Command\\nSystem/Unified Command. The National Response Team(cid:146)s Technical Assistance\\ndocument  has  been  distributed  to  all  EPA  on-scene  coordinator[s],  and  EPA\\nheadquarters  has  encouraged \\nIncident  Command\\nSystem/Unified Command into their Area Contingency Plans (ACP). However,\\nEPA(cid:146)s  Regions  have  been  provided  the  flexibility,  consistent  with  the  National\\nResponse Team(cid:146)s Technical Assistance Document, to adopt response management\\nstructures  that  use  an  Incident  Command  System  that  may  be  consistent  with\\nNational  Interagency  Incident  Management  System  [NIIMS].  The  Region  III\\nInland Area Contingency Plan calls for a Unified Incident Command System that\\nis not based on NIIMS.\\n\\ninclusion  of \\n\\nthe \\n\\nthe \\n\\nEPA  has  provided  no  written  guidance  to  its  regions  on  the  use  of  Incident\\nCommand  System/Unified  Command  beyond  that  provided  in  the  National  Response\\nTeam  Technical  Assistance  Document  Incident  Command  System/Unified  Command(cid:151)\\nManaging  Responses  to  Oil  Discharges  and  Hazardous  Substance  Releases  under  the\\nNational Contingency Plan. The National Response Team, with the Regional Response\\nTeams, constitutes the Federal component of the National Response System. The National\\nResponse Team and Regional Response Teams are made up of 16 Federal departments and\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n34\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nagencies. The EPA chairs the National Response Team, and the Coast Guard serves as\\nVice Chair.\\n\\nThe  EPA(cid:146)s  Office  of  Emergency  and  Remedial  Response  is  developing  an  EPA\\n\\npolicy position on the Incident Command System.\\n\\nPostaccident Assessments of Chalk Point Response\\n\\nEPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator.  In  her  postaccident  report  on  the  Chalk\\nPoint  response,33  the  EPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  made  numerous  findings\\nconcerning a wide range of areas in which the response could have been improved and\\nmade  suggestions  to  improve  future  responses.  She  acknowledged  that  the  lack  of  a\\nNational  Interagency  Incident  Management  System-based  Incident  Command  System\\nstructure hindered the establishment of resource tracking and accountability as the Chalk\\nPoint incident progressed. She also stated that because local responders were not included\\nin  the  immediate  response,  their  capabilities  were  not  effectively  used  to  disseminate\\ninformation to the community or to coordinate response efforts.\\n\\nRegional  Response  Team.  In  its  April 5,  2001,  report  on  the  Chalk  Point\\naccident  response,34  the  Regional  Response  Team  review  committee  found  that  there\\nappeared to have been no effective response management system, especially early in the\\nincident.  The  committee  considered  that  the  task-oriented  management  structure\\noriginally used was not conducive to managing the rapid expansion of a major oil spill.\\nThe  committee  added  that,  although  each  incident  is  different,  major  oil  spills  have\\npredictable elements that can be managed more effectively via Incident Command/Unified\\nCommand  systems.  As  a  result,  the  Regional  Response  Team  review  committee\\nrecommended that, in future incidents, the Incident Command/Unified Command system\\nbe immediately activated at the spill site to ensure that authority and responsibility are\\nclearly assigned. Further, the Regional Response Team stated that the EPA should develop\\na  guidance  document  on  how  to  set  up  and  run  Incident  Command/Unified  Command\\nsystems, train all Federal On-Scene Coordinators in Incident Command/Unified Command\\nsystems,  and  consider  augmenting  the  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  with  an  Incident\\nCommand System/Unified Command management team.\\n\\nCoast Guard. In his August 25, 2001, letter addressing lessons learned from the\\nChalk  Point  accident  response,  the  Chief  of  Marine  Safety  for  the  Fifth  Coast  Guard\\nDistrict indicated that the significant delay in establishing an Incident Command System\\ncontributed to a fragmented and ineffective response. He further stated:\\n\\nThe  Coast  Guard  has  adopted  the  Incident  Command  System  (ICS)  as  its\\nemergency  response  process.  We  have  found  ICS  to  be  a  very  effective  spill\\nmanagement  tool;  particularly  as  the  system  is  used  by  most  State  and  Local\\nresponse entities as well.\\n\\n33 Environmental  Protection  Agency,  After-Action  Report  for  Emergency  Response  at  the  Swanson\\nCreek Oil Spill Site, Aquasco, Maryland, Prince George(cid:146)s, Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary(cid:146)s Counties 7 April\\n2000 to 16 May 2000.\\n\\n34 Swanson Preparedness and Response Review: Swanson Creek Marsh Oil Spill (cid:150) April 2000, Final\\n\\nReport, dated April 5, 2001.\\n\\n\\x0cFactual Information\\n\\n35\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nHe noted that, although it appeared that the oil was well-contained in the wetlands\\nearly in the response, other factors were at play (wind, predicted storm, etc.) that might\\nhave  led  experienced  response  managers  to  recognize  the  precarious  nature  of  the\\nsituation.  He  indicated  that  responders  conducting  overflights  or  other  assessment\\nactivities should have analyzed the gathered information more accurately and realized that\\nthe oil was liable to break out of containment and enter the Patuxent River.\\n\\nHe further found that the limited involvement of the local response community had\\na negative effect on the response effort. He indicated that local responders play a major\\nrole in site safety, provide local information needed by responders from other areas, and\\ncan help to establish the Unified Command and Incident Command System structures as\\nsoon as they arrive on the scene.\\n\\nNovember 2000 Safety Board Hearing on Pipeline Safety\\n\\nOn November 15 and 16, 2000, the Safety Board held a pipeline safety hearing\\nthat focused on pipeline inspection, integrity verification, and leak detection and response.\\nParticipating in the meeting were representatives of Federal agencies, including the Safety\\nBoard, RSPA, and the Office of Pipeline Safety; the pipeline industry, including pipeline\\noperators, in-line pipeline inspection services, and integrity assessment consultants; and\\nacademia and research institutes.35\\n\\nIn  addition  to  addressing  a  wide  range  of  other  pipeline  safety  issues,  pipeline\\nindustry  representatives  stressed  the  need  for  pipeline  leak  detection  systems  to  have\\naccurate pipeline instrumentation located at sensing sites. During the hearing, the RSPA\\nAdministrator stated that, to increase their efficiency, leak detection systems must be less\\ndependent on the human pipeline controller. Hearing testimony also indicated that many\\nleaks could be detected in a matter of minutes with a computational pipeline monitoring\\nsystem,  which  would  reduce  the  reliance  of  pipeline  system  operating  parameters  on\\nhuman input.\\n\\n35 For  additional  information  on  the  presentations  made  during  the  November  2000  pipeline  safety\\n\\nhearing, see the Web link at <http://www.ntsb.gov/events/2000/pipeline_hearing/default.htm>.\\n\\n\\x0c36\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nThe Accident\\n\\nAbout  0715  on  April 7,  2000,  employees  of  Pepco(cid:146)s  contractor,  ST  Services,\\nlaunched a cleaning pig in flushing oil from Pepco(cid:146)s Chalk Point Station toward Ryceville\\nStation on the Piney Point Oil Pipeline. For the next several hours, periodic tank levels\\nwere taken for the Chalk Point (origin) and the Ryceville (destination) Stations(cid:146) flushing\\noil tanks, but tank volumes were not calculated from the tank level readings and evaluated\\nfor  line  balance  as  the  pumping  operation  proceeded.  Because  the  pumping  was\\nprogressing faster than expected, ST Services personnel operating the pipeline expected\\nthe cleaning pig to arrive at the Ryceville Station between about 1300 and 1330, but it did\\nnot.  The  ST  Services  Chalk  Point  operator  became  concerned  and  double-checked  the\\ntank level about 1412 because the pig had not arrived at Ryceville, and the Chalk Point\\npump  began  cavitating  at  1430.  About  the  same  time,  the  flow  of  oil  stopped  at  the\\nRyceville Station.\\n\\nBy  1440,  pipeline  personnel  had  initiated  the  acquisition  of  current  tank  level\\nmeasurements for line balance calculations at both stations and the checking of the Chalk\\nPoint manifold for misaligned valves. By 1534, they had calculated that Ryceville had not\\nreceived  3,089 barrels  (129,738 gallons)  of  the  oil  that  had  been  pumped  from  Chalk\\nPoint. At 1538, pipeline operating personnel shut down the pipeline and initiated surface\\ninspections at locations where the pipeline crosses roads and Swanson Creek to look for\\nan  oil  leak.  By  1802,  a  pipeline  aerial  patrol,  which  had  been  launched  earlier  at  the\\ndirection of the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations, had reported sighting\\na pipeline leak in the wetlands near Swanson Creek, not far from the Chalk Point Station.\\n\\nPostaccident calculations performed by the Piney Point Oil Pipeline owners, which\\nwere  based  on  review  of  the  recorded  pipeline  pressure  information,  the  operating\\nconditions at the time of the accident, the size of the crack, and the amount of product\\nspilled, indicated that the pipe failure occurred before 0930 on April 7, 2000, probably\\nwhen the Chalk Point pump was started, about 0715, and the pipeline pressure was at its\\nhighest level. The Safety Board reviewed this analysis and found it credible.\\n\\nThe pipeline ruptured at a wrinkle in a section of pipe that had been field-bent\\nduring initial construction of the pipeline in 1971 and 1972. The deformation, or wrinkle,\\nthat  failed  was  a  single  outward  deflection  of  the  pipe  wall,  commonly  described  as  a\\nbuckle. After the pipeline was placed in service, forces imposed on the deformed area of\\nthe  bend,  including  the  normal  operating  pressure  and  thermal  cycles  in  the  pipeline,\\ncaused repeated straining and eventual cracking until the pipe at the deformed area failed.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n37\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nPipeline In-line Inspection\\n\\nAlthough  in-line  inspections  were  not  mandated,  Pepco  maintained  a  program\\nunder  which  it  periodically  had  in-line  inspections  conducted  on  the  Piney  Point  Oil\\nPipeline  to  help  ensure  pipeline  integrity.  Pipetronix,  an  ultrasonic  in-line  inspection\\ncontractor,  had  conducted  the  last  inspection  of  the  pipeline  before  the  accident  on\\nAugust 16,  1997.  When  the  April 7,  2000,  accident  occurred,  Pepco  was  preparing  the\\nPiney Point Oil Pipeline for another in-line inspection.\\n\\nIn accordance with its contract with Pepco for the August 1997 in-line inspection,\\nPipetronix examined the segment of the Piney Point Oil Pipeline from Ryceville to Chalk\\nPoint to identify corrosion, gouging, pipeline fittings, girth welds, wall thickness changes,\\nspecial features, and differentiation  between  internal  and  external corrosion. Pipetronix\\ninterpreted and checked the ultrasonic tool data from the inspection using computer-based\\nsystems and manual review by its technicians. The Pipetronix report to Pepco concerning\\nthe  in-line  inspection  results  and  Pipetronix(cid:146)s  interpretation  of  the  results  included  an\\nappendix that identified and located various pipeline features by station number.\\n\\nPipetronix(cid:146)s  interpretation  of  the  ultrasonic  tool  data  contained  a  significant\\ninaccuracy for the feature at odometer station 53526.55. This feature, which was found\\nafter the accident to be a buckle but was inaccurately interpreted by the Pipetronix analyst\\nas a T-piece, failed and resulted in the leak on April 7, 2000. Based on interpretation of the\\ndata available to Pipetronix at the time of the inspection, the Pipetronix analyst should\\nhave  interpreted  the  feature  as  an  (cid:147)unknown(cid:148)  because  it  did  not  match  the  signal\\ncharacteristic for a T-piece. Had Pepco been notified that the feature was an unknown, it\\nmight have attempted to determine the feature(cid:146)s true characteristics, through excavation or\\nother means. Therefore, the Safety Board concludes that because Pipetronix incorrectly\\ninterpreted the results of its ultrasonic tool data for the pipeline feature at odometer station\\n53526.55, Pepco was not alerted to the need for additional evaluation of the pipe at the\\nlocation  where  it  subsequently  ruptured.  After  the  accident,  Pipetronix  updated  its\\nreference library and training materials to include the signal characteristics of the outward\\nprotruding buckle that failed in this accident.\\n\\nEvaluation of Pipe Wrinkles\\n\\nAfter  the  accident,  RSPA  required  Mirant  (which  became  the  pipeline(cid:146)s  owner\\nsome  months  after  the  accident)  to  prepare  an  integrity  study  of  the  Piney  Point  Oil\\nPipeline before it would allow the pipeline to be returned to service. Data from the 1997\\nin-line  inspection  of  the  pipeline  were  compared  to  the  actual  geometry  of  various\\nwrinkles  in  pipeline  bends,  obtained  after  excavating  the  most  severe  wrinkles  and\\ndetermining the geometry by field measurements. After correlation between the in-line\\ninspection data and the field measurements was completed, the 1997 in-line inspection\\ndata were used as the basis for the evaluation of wrinkles that had not been excavated and\\ninspected.  An  analysis  was  performed  to  determine  if  identified  wrinkles  needed  to  be\\nremoved. As a result of this work, Mirant developed quantitative acceptance criteria for\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n38\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\npipe wrinkles remaining in the pipeline. RSPA accepted the analysis that indicated that\\nsome wrinkles could remain in the pipeline, and RSPA allowed the pipeline to return to\\nservice.\\n\\nField bends containing wrinkles were installed in pipelines before the hazardous\\nliquid pipeline safety regulations went into effect in 1970. Since then, pipeline regulations\\nhave  prohibited  the  installation  of  pipe  containing  wrinkle  bends  during  pipeline\\nconstruction.36 However, pipe wrinkles that were not discovered during the construction\\ninspection process or that formed sometime after construction are still periodically found\\nin pipelines.\\n\\nAccording  to  RSPA(cid:146)s  pipeline  integrity  management  rule,  when  an  in-line\\ninspection tool is selected by a pipeline operator to assess the condition of the pipeline, it\\nmust  be  (cid:147)capable  of  detecting  corrosion  and  deformation  anomalies  including  dents,\\ngouges, and grooves(cid:148) in high-consequence areas.37 The regulation states that (cid:147)an operator\\nmust  evaluate  all  anomalies  and  repair  those  anomalies  that  could  reduce  a  pipeline(cid:146)s\\nintegrity.(cid:148)38  Although  the  language  in  this  regulation  does  not  specifically  designate\\nwrinkles as a category of deformation anomaly, when questioned by Safety Board staff,\\nRSPA officials indicated that the regulation applies to wrinkles.\\n\\nWrinkles can sometimes be identified through the use of in-line inspection tools.\\nHowever, operators do not have nationally recognized quantitative criteria with which to\\nassess the effect of a specific wrinkle characteristic on a pipe or to determine whether a\\npipeline  can  be  safely  operated  while  it  contains  some  wrinkles.  Therefore,  the  Safety\\nBoard  concludes  that  because pipeline  operators  have  no  nationally  recognized  criteria\\nwith which to evaluate pipe wrinkles, they may not be effectively determining whether\\npipe  containing  wrinkles  should  be  allowed  to  remain  in  service.  The  Safety  Board\\nbelieves  that  RSPA  should  establish  quantitative  criteria,  based  on  engineering\\nevaluations, for determining whether a wrinkle may be allowed to remain in a pipeline.\\n\\nLeak Detection\\n\\nAfter the Chalk Point leak began, sometime before 0930 on April 7, 2000, it was\\nhours before those operating the Piney Point Oil Pipeline recognized that a line balance\\nshortage,  which  might  indicate  a  leak,  was  developing.  The  leak  might  have  been\\nrecognized much sooner if more systematic leak detection procedures and practices had\\nbeen in place and used.\\n\\nDuring normal deliveries of No. 6 fuel oil to the Chalk Point Generating Station,\\nPepco(cid:146)s  automated  pipeline  monitoring  system  was  designed  to  provide  alarms  for\\npressure,  temperature,  and  flow  rate  to  the  pipeline  controller  for  operating  conditions\\n\\n36 49 CFR 195.212.\\n37 49 CFR 195.452(c)(1)(i)(A).\\n38 49 CFR 195.452(h)(1).\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n39\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\noutside of predetermined limits. During the pigging operation on the day of the accident,\\nhowever, the meters and pressure-sensing points at Chalk Point were not in the flushing\\noil(cid:146)s flow path, and the temperature-sensing equipment was not in the direct flow path to\\nRyceville. Thus, Pepco(cid:146)s automated pipeline monitoring and leak detection system on the\\nPiney  Point  Oil  Pipeline  did  not  alert  the  ST  Services  personnel  to  the  developing\\nproblem.\\n\\nWith respect to manual monitoring of the pipeline, ST Services did not require its\\npersonnel to perform line balance calculations while conducting either normal pipeline or\\npigging operations, nor did the procedures in Pepco(cid:146)s Piney Point Oil Pipeline Manual\\ninclude such requirements. Although ST Services personnel took tank level measurements\\nat both the Chalk Point and Ryceville Stations throughout the morning of April 7, they did\\nnot  use  this  information  to  evaluate  whether  product  had  been  lost  from  the  pipeline.\\nBased on the speed of the pigging operation and his previous experience, the ST Services\\nChalk  Point  operator  updated  the  estimated  cleaning  pig  arrival  time  at  the  Ryceville\\nStation from about 1415 to between 1300 and 1330. Even when the pig failed to arrive\\nduring this period, ST Services personnel still did not evaluate the tank level information\\nto check the line balance. It was not until the Chalk Point pump began cavitating and the\\nflow  of  oil  stopped  at  the  Ryceville  Station,  about  1430,  that  ST  Services  personnel\\nrecognized a problem. Between 1440 and 1534, using tank level measurements for line\\nbalance calculations, they determined that Ryceville had not received 3,089 barrels of the\\noil that had been pumped from Chalk Point, and they shut the pipeline down at 1538.\\n\\nOn April 7, 2000, therefore, Pepco(cid:146)s procedures, as provided in the Piney Point Oil\\nPipeline Manual, were inadequate because they did not require ST Services personnel to\\nconduct  line  balancing  during  pigging  operations,  and  ST  Services(cid:146)  practices  were\\ninadequate  because  they  did  not  include  effective  line  balancing  during  the  pigging\\noperation. Although some manual tank levels were obtained throughout the day, they were\\nnot  evaluated.  Had  line  balance  been  determined  on  a  timely  basis,  the  line  balance\\ndiscrepancy would likely have been discovered within about an hour of its occurrence.\\nThe Safety Board concludes that the absence of effective pipeline monitoring procedures\\nand  practices,  including  periodic  line  balancing,  delayed  the  discovery  of  the  fuel  oil\\nshortage on April 7, 2000, which delayed the pipeline shutdown and allowed more oil to\\nleak from the pipeline.\\n\\nAs a result of a pipeline accident in North Blenheim, New York,39 the Safety Board\\n\\nissued Safety Recommendation P-91-1 to RSPA. It read:\\n\\n39 National  Transportation  Safety  Board,  Liquid  Propane  Pipeline  Rupture  and  Fire,  Texas  Eastern\\nProducts  Pipeline  Company,  North  Blenheim,  New  York,  March 13,  1990,  Pipeline  Accident  Report\\nNTSB/PAR-91/01 (Washington, DC: NTSB, 1991).\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n40\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nP-91-1\\nDefine the operating parameters that must be monitored by pipeline operators to\\ndetect abnormal operations and establish performance standards that must be met\\nby pipeline monitoring systems installed to detect and locate leaks.\\n\\nSafety Recommendation P-91-1 is classified (cid:147)Open(cid:151)Unacceptable Response.(cid:148)\\n\\nRSPA,  in  its  1991  and  1992  responses  to  the  recommendation,  indicated  that  it\\nintended to conduct a study of SCADA systems. In response to a 1997 follow-up status\\ninquiry  from  the  Safety  Board,  RSPA  indicated  that  it  would  soon  issue  rulemaking\\nconcerning leak detection standards.\\n\\nIn 1998, RSPA incorporated parts of an industry standard for leak detection, API\\nStandard 1130, Computational Pipeline Monitoring, in its hazardous liquid pipeline safety\\nregulations.  In  49 CFR Part 195,  computational  pipeline  monitoring  is  defined  as  a\\n(cid:147)software-based monitoring tool that alerts the pipeline dispatcher of a possible pipeline\\noperating anomaly that may be indicative of a commodity release.(cid:148) Title 49 CFR 195.134,\\nwhich is the safety regulation requiring the use of API Standard 1130 for design, applies\\nwhen  operators  are  replacing  a  component  of  an  existing  computational  pipeline\\nmonitoring  system  or  installing  a  new  computational  pipeline  monitoring  system  on  a\\npipeline; the regulation does not require that such systems be installed.\\n\\nSince  the  April  2000  accident,  Pepco  initiated,  and  Mirant  completed,  the\\ninstallation  of  a  new  SCADA  system  that  meets  API  Standard 1130,  and  a  pipeline\\ncontroller will continuously monitor it. This system includes additional instrumentation,\\nsensors, and controls, as well as a computer model that uses current pipeline operating\\nconditions. The system continuously calculates line balances to enable early detection and\\nwarning,  and  it  allows  the  pipeline  controller  to  initiate  remote  shutdown.  Mirant  now\\noperates the pipeline with its own employees, and the pipeline controller is engaged in\\nactive analysis and monitoring of pipeline operations. Mirant has revised the operating\\nprocedures so that the pipeline controller initiates an immediate shutdown when a flow\\nshortage  outside  of  predetermined  limits  is  indicated  by  its  new  SCADA-based  leak\\ndetection system.\\n\\nAt  a  Safety  Board  pipeline  safety  hearing  held  in  November  2000,  panelists\\ndiscussed  various  types  of  automated  monitoring  systems  that  make  leak  detection\\npossible  within  a  matter  of  minutes.  In  contrast,  manual  line  balancing  relies  on\\nacquisition  of  data  by  pipeline  operators.  Manual  computation  and  evaluation  are  then\\nrequired to develop the pipeline operating data. The manual process requires more time to\\ncomplete than an automated system, and the input data are more susceptible to human\\nerror than data obtained and used by an automated monitoring system.\\n\\nOn  December 1,  2000,  RSPA  issued  a  new  regulation  at  49 CFR 195.452,\\nrequiring  hazardous  liquid  operators  with  500  or  more  miles  of  pipeline  to  provide\\npipeline  integrity  management.  On  January 16,  2002,  RSPA  amended  the  regulation  to\\ninclude operators that own or operate less than 500 miles of regulated hazardous liquid\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n41\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\npipelines. The regulation requires that operators have a (cid:147)means to detect(cid:148) leaks on their\\npipeline  systems  in  high-consequence  areas,  but  it  does  not  specify  what  constitutes\\nadequate means to detect leaks.\\n\\nRSPA officials met with Safety Board staff on May 16, 2002. In response to Safety\\nBoard staff questions about how RSPA will enforce the new leak detection requirements,\\nRSPA officials indicated that they are developing specific criteria for defining adequate\\nleak detection measures and that the  criteria will be posted and enforced.40 The Safety\\nBoard  supports  this  effort  and  encourages  RSPA  to  expedite  the  development  of  the\\ncriteria  and,  as  part  of  the  process,  to  consider  increased  system  automation  to  ensure\\ntimely leak detection.\\n\\nLeak-related Notifications\\n\\nOnce the ST Services pipeline operators confirmed that they had a leak, they began\\nto  initiate  an  emergency  response.  The  emergency  response  was  affected  by  several\\ncommunications  breakdowns.  Pepco  did  not  provide  accurate  information  about  the\\nvolume of the Chalk Point oil release to public agencies, nor did Pepco ensure that its\\ninternal information exchanges were effectively coordinated. The failures left responders\\nwith inadequate information with which to evaluate the threat posed by the release.\\n\\nIn the case of the Chalk Point accident, the response of deploying booms initially\\ncontained the oil spill, despite failures to effectively notify responders about the scope of\\nthe accident and to inform local response agencies early in the response effort. However,\\nin  future  incidents  involving  pipeline  leaks,  such  notification  errors  could  cause\\nresponders to fail to respond with the resources needed to deal with a release, which could\\nhave negative consequences.\\n\\nInaccurate National Response Center Notification\\n\\nBetween 1538, when the pipeline was shut down, and 1850, when the National\\nResponse Center received notification of the Chalk Point spill, miscommunications and\\nthe creation of a release estimate lacking any factual basis took place among the various\\nPepco  officials  managing  the  release.  By  the  time  they  shut  down  the  pipeline,  ST\\nServices  personnel  were  aware  that  they  had  a  line  balance  discrepancy  of  about\\n3,000 barrels (126,000 gallons). Sometime before 1620, the ST Services assistant terminal\\nmanager  told  the  Pepco  engineering  supervisor  that  the  line  balance  discrepancy  was\\nabout 3,000 barrels. The Pepco engineering supervisor informed the Pepco Chalk Point\\ngeneral supervisor for operations about the discrepancy at 1620, stating that it was about\\n2,000  to  3,000 barrels.  At  this  time,  the  Pepco  Chalk  Point  general  supervisor  for\\noperations noted in his log that there was a discrepancy of 2,000 barrels.\\n\\n40 In  addition,  RSPA  is  soliciting  research  proposals  to  advance  leak  detection  technologies  by\\nimproving leak detection timeliness and accuracy and by developing improved means of detecting small\\npipeline leaks.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n42\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nAbout 1827, a still more significant error took place concerning the estimation of\\nthe  size  of  the  spill.  The  Pepco  Chalk  Point  shift  supervisor  told  the  Pepco  qualified\\nindividual (when pressed to provide an estimate) that the amount of the spill was (cid:147)1,000\\ngallons,  2,000  gallons,  [expletive]  mess,  tell  them  what  you  want.(cid:148)  This  unfounded\\nestimate was reported to the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor for operations, who, in\\nconsultation  with \\nthe  Pepco  senior  environmental  coordinator  during  a  phone\\nconversation, agreed to report a release of 2,000 gallons to the National Response Center\\nand  the  Maryland  Department  of  the  Environment.  About  1840,  ST  Services  provided\\nadditional confirmation to the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor that the line balance\\nshortage  was  approximately  3,000 barrels  (126,000 gallons).  About  1850,  the  Pepco\\nsenior  environmental  coordinator  called  the  National  Response  Center  and  reported  a\\n2,000-gallon  No. 2  fuel  oil  release  from  a  pipeline  at  Pepco(cid:146)s  Chalk  Point  Generating\\nStation, even though the Pepco Chalk Point general supervisor had updated information\\nthat the line balance shortage was actually about 3,000 barrels (126,000 gallons).\\n\\nBy 2015, the estimated release amount of 3,000 barrels (126,000 gallons) had been\\nposted on the Chalk Point command center information blackboard. Shortly after 2100,\\nthe Pepco engineering group confirmed with line balance calculations that the amount of\\nflushing oil involved in the release was 3,089 barrels (129,738 gallons).\\n\\nPepco  officials  could  have  updated  the  National  Response  Center  when  they\\nlearned that the information they had initially reported was inaccurate, but they did not.\\nThe Pepco senior environmental coordinator learned within 2 hours that the 2,000-gallon\\nrelease  estimate  he  had  given  the  National  Response  Center  did  not  approach  the  true\\nmagnitude of the release, but neither he nor any other Pepco manager updated the report.\\nWhen  asked  why  he  never  updated  the  National  Response  Center,  the  Pepco  senior\\nenvironmental coordinator said he believed that by 2130 on April 7, representatives of all\\nthe notified agencies were on the scene or were in contact with each other. In fact, the EPA\\nFederal  On-Scene  Coordinator  was  not  advised  of  the  revised  spill  estimate  until  she\\narrived at Chalk Point at 1015 on April 8, about 13 hours after Pepco had confirmation\\nthat the likely size of the spill was 3,089 barrels (129,738 gallons). Thus, those oil spill\\nresponders  who  received  notification  from  the  National  Response  Center  were  not\\ninformed of the significant size of the product release and the spill(cid:146)s potential impact on\\nthe environment until they arrived on the scene.\\n\\nDuring the May 16, 2002, meeting between RSPA officials and Safety Board staff,\\nRSPA officials stated that National Response Center notification reports are intended to\\nprovide  responders,  as  quickly  as  possible,  the  information  they  need  to  activate\\nappropriate  resources  to  control,  mitigate,  and/or  clean  up  a  product  spill.  Emergency\\nresponders,  as  well  as  accident  investigators,  rely  on  the  information  provided  by  the\\nNational Response Center when preparing their response efforts. Inaccurate or incomplete\\ninformation can hamper these activities. For instance, if the initial information reported\\nerroneously indicates that the release is minor, some Government responders needed on\\nthe scene to carry out containment or mitigation efforts may decide not to respond to the\\naccident. And if they do respond, they may not bring sufficient resources to manage the\\nspill.  For  those  Government  agencies  that  send  personnel  to  the  accident,  the  National\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n43\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nResponse  Center  report  may  be  the  only  information  that  the  responders  have  before\\narriving  on  the  scene.  The  more  complete  the  information  is,  the  better  prepared\\nGovernment responders will be to react to the particular circumstances of the accident.\\n\\nIn addition to the Chalk Point accident, the Safety Board is aware of other cases in\\nwhich pipeline owners or operators reporting an incident to the National Response Center\\ndid not update their initial reports when more comprehensive and accurate information\\nbecame  available.41  The  Safety  Board  concludes  that  because  pipeline  owners  and\\noperators sometimes do not update their initial reports to the National Response Center,\\nthe notifications provided to emergency responders may not always contain the complete\\nand accurate information needed to develop an effective incident response. Therefore, the\\nSafety Board believes that RSPA should require pipeline owners and operators to provide\\nfollow-up telephone updates to the National Response Center when they discover that the\\ninformation  they  initially  reported  contains  significant  errors  or  when  they  identify\\nsignificant new information directly related to the reporting criteria.\\n\\nLimited Involvement of Local Response Agencies\\n\\nPepco considered that, under the Chalk Point oil spill response plan, the release did\\nnot  meet  the  criteria  for  notification  of  local  response  agencies,  which  were  (cid:147)fire,\\nexplosion, personal injury or release or significant threat of release off-site.(cid:148) Although the\\naccident  might  not  have  immediately  met  these  specific  criteria,  Pepco  should  have\\nrealized that the Chalk Point leak, due to its proximity to Swanson Creek, which fed into\\nthe Patuxent River, had the potential for a significant off-site release. However, Pepco did\\nnot  contact  local  response  agencies,  including  the  Prince  George(cid:146)s  County  Fire\\nDepartment. As a result, the resources of the local response agencies were not utilized as\\nsoon as possible.\\n\\nIn her postaccident review, the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator stated that she\\nbelieved the exclusion of local responders from the initial response (having been notified\\nonly once State responders were already on-scene) had a negative impact on the response\\noperations, particularly with respect to the dissemination of information to the community\\nand the ability to coordinate response efforts. In addition, the Chief of Marine Safety for\\nthe  Fifth  Coast  Guard  District  stated,  in  an  August 25,  2000,  letter  addressing  lessons\\nlearned from the Chalk Point accident, that the local responders are needed to ensure the\\nsafety of the site, share local knowledge with the spill management team, and mobilize\\nessential resources to the scene.\\n\\nMirant, the current owner of the Piney Point Oil Pipeline, has significantly revised\\nthe oil spill response procedures for the pipeline. In April 2002, RSPA approved Mirant(cid:146)s\\noil spill response plan. After the Chalk Point accident, the Oil Spill Emergency Response\\nPlan for the Ryceville Pumping Station and Pipeline was revised to improve and clarify it.\\n\\n41 A March 30, 1998, accident in Sandy Springs, Georgia, that was originally reported to the National\\nResponse  Center  as  a  release  of  150  gallons  of  gasoline  was  later  found  to  be  a  release  of  over  15,800\\ngallons.  An  August 20,  2001,  accident  in  Jackson  County,  Oklahoma,  that  was  initially  reported  to  the\\nNational Response Center as a release of 8,400 gallons of crude oil was later found to be a release of about\\n126,000 gallons.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n44\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nFurther, on July 27, 2001, Mirant published the manual Response Strategies for Southern\\nMaryland, which was based on (cid:147)operational experience gained during the Swanson Creek\\noil spill response and studies.(cid:148)42 The Safety Board notes that Mirant personnel met with\\nthe  members  of  the  Local  Emergency  Planning  Committee,  which  represents  the  local\\npublic  response  agencies  of  the  four  surrounding  counties,  to  familiarize  the  members\\nwith the implementation of the manual. In the less than 2 years since Mirant became the\\nowner of the pipeline, it has conducted at least 15 drills concerning elements of effective\\nspill response, and some of the drills have involved local response agencies. The Safety\\nBoard  notes  these  Mirant  efforts  to  provide  prompt  involvement  of  local  response\\nagencies in any future emergencies.\\n\\nIncident Command\\n\\nThe Safety Board found that the lack of effective incident command had a negative\\neffect on the emergency response to the Chalk Point release. ST Services, Pepco, and spill\\nrecovery  contractors  on  the  scene  on  April 7  and  8,  2000,  were  initially  successful  in\\ndeploying  a  boom  system  that  contained the leading edge of the spill. On the night of\\nApril 8, however, with the arrival of a severe storm that included heavy rains and 50-mph\\nwinds, the boom containment system was overwhelmed. The spill escaped containment\\nand ultimately traveled an estimated 17 miles (linear) downstream and oiled 40 miles of\\nshoreline in Prince George(cid:146)s, Charles, Calvert, and St. Mary(cid:146)s Counties. Responders were\\nunable to effectively mitigate the environmental impact of the oil(cid:146)s entry into the Patuxent\\nRiver, due in part to incident management and oversight deficiencies.\\n\\nThe EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator arrived on the scene at 1015 on April 8\\nand  began  attempting  to  coordinate  the  Unified  Command  without  establishing  an\\nIncident  Command  System.  Instead,  she  relied  on  a  project  management  structure  that\\ngave the responsible party, Pepco, primary responsibility for directing and monitoring the\\nactivities  of  response  contractors.  Throughout  April 8,  the  Unified  Command(cid:146)s  efforts\\nwere focused on containing the spill within the Swanson Creek wetlands area. Pepco(cid:146)s\\ncontractors conducted the booming operation based on the directions they received from\\nPepco officials, who received their orders from the Unified Command.\\n\\nManagement problems were evident even at this early stage. The Pepco officials\\nworking with the contractors were on rotating 8-hour shifts, and those personnel going\\noff-duty sometimes did not fully discuss response developments and necessary tasks with\\nthose  coming  on-duty.  This  lack  of  continuity  caused  problems  with  task  and  status\\ncommunication  and  coordination.  Instances  of  miscommunication  and  problems  with\\nunclear lines of authority occurred. Important meetings were not attended by all necessary\\npersonnel, and Pepco contractors sometimes did not fully understand the tasks they were\\n\\n42 The  manual  is  intended  to  provide  tactical  information  for  use  as  a  pre-planning  document  for\\nresponse  managers  and  crews.  It  identifies  key  control  points  along  and  off  the  pipeline  corridor  where\\nresponse actions may be taken should a release occur. The manual also includes a summary sheet for each of\\nthe primary control point locations.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n45\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nassigned.  The  EPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  also  did  not  have  extensive  Federal\\nresponse resources to draw upon at this time.\\n\\nA storm was predicted for that evening, and the Unified Command and the EPA\\nFederal  On-Scene  Coordinator  ordered,  and  Pepco(cid:146)s  contractors  took,  reasonable\\nprecautions  to  maintain  the  containment  they  had  achieved  in  the  Swanson  Creek\\nwetlands area. However, the storm was more severe than had been anticipated, and the\\nouter  booms  at  the  Patuxent  River  were  breached  about  2030,  releasing  a  significant\\namount of oil into the river.\\n\\nFor the next 2 days (April 9 and 10), the Unified Command, under the direction of\\nthe EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator, attempted to mount an effective response to the\\noil  spill(cid:146)s  escape  into  the  river.  Significant  resource  and  organizational  problems  arose\\nimmediately.  Pepco  had  difficulty  obtaining  contractor  resources  that  could  carry  out\\nmarine  operations,  and  the  EPA  Federal  On-Scene  Coordinator  encountered  similar\\nproblems when she attempted to augment the response effort with Federal resources. Even\\nmore  importantly,  the  contractors  hired  by  Pepco  were  not  completing  urgent  assigned\\ntasks,  and  the  delays  in  the  response  effort  were  not  being  promptly  and  accurately\\nreported to the Unified Command. The EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator stated that in\\nthe 2 days following the escape of the oil into the river, the Unified Command repeatedly\\ndirected  Pepco  to  ensure  that  several  environmentally  sensitive  creeks  leading  into  the\\nriver  were  protectively  boomed.  According  to  the  EPA  Federal  On-scene  Coordinator,\\nPepco repeatedly indicated that appropriate action was being taken and that the booms\\nwould  be  placed  as  soon  as  possible.  As  of  April 11,  no  booms  had  been  deployed  to\\nprotect the creeks, and two creeks showed evidence of oil contamination.\\n\\nTo  address  the  coordination  and  communication  problems  and  the  contractors(cid:146)\\ninability to complete assigned tasks, the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator decided that\\nan Incident Command System structure had to be implemented. Such a system is designed\\nto provide more direct Federal control over response activities, a quicker response to spill\\ndevelopments,  greater  access  to  a  wider  range  of  resources,  and  better  responder\\ncoordination. Consequently, she requested at 1430 on April 10 that Coast Guard officials\\nassisting  on  scene  develop  such  a  structure.  She  also  urged  Pepco  to  hire  a  spill\\nmanagement contractor to improve the logistics of its contractors(cid:146) efforts.\\n\\nOn  the  morning  of  April 11,  the  Coast  Guard  Captain  of  the  Port  of  Baltimore\\narrived with additional personnel to staff the Incident Command System structure that had\\nbeen developed. The new personnel were deployed to monitor the field operations being\\nconducted by Pepco(cid:146)s contractors to ensure that work was completed as directed. Almost\\nimmediately,  with  the  marshalling  of  the  additional  personnel  and  equipment,  the\\neffectiveness of the recovery operations improved. Protective booms were provided for\\nthe  threatened  creeks  on  April 12  and  13.  Within  days,  marine-specialist  responders\\nfinished collecting the free oil in the main body of the Patuxent River, and they were able\\nto  concentrate  their  efforts  on  oil  collection  from  the  affected  creeks  and  other\\nenvironmental mediation projects.\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n46\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nIn  their  postaccident  assessments  of  the  Chalk  Point  accident,  both  the  Coast\\nGuard and the Regional Response Team review committee concluded that the response\\nwould have benefited from earlier use of an Incident Command System as the incident(cid:146)s\\ncoordination  and  management  structure.  In  fact,  the  Regional  Response  Team  review\\ncommittee  recommended  that  the  EPA  develop  a  manual  on  how  to  use  Incident\\nCommand  System/Unified  Command  structures  and  train  all  Federal  On-Scene\\nCoordinators  in  Incident  Command  System/Unified  Command  principles.  In  her  own\\nassessment of the response, the EPA Federal On-Scene Coordinator acknowledged that the\\ndecision not to implement an Incident Command System structure immediately upon her\\narrival at the accident scene ultimately had a detrimental effect on the response effort.\\n\\nOnce the oil escaped from containment in the wetlands and the situation became\\nmore complex and difficult to resolve, the short-term project management approach could\\nnot achieve results with the speed and efficiency needed to avoid a serious environmental\\nimpact. The Incident Command System has proven its effectiveness in incidents covering\\na wide range of transportation modes, and it has usually improved the management of a\\ncomplex incident response effort, such as the one that evolved from the Chalk Point oil\\nleak. Once the structure was applied at Chalk Point, response efforts soon became more\\nefficient and successful. The Safety Board concludes that, because it did not initially put a\\nfully  implemented  Incident  Command  System  in  place,  the  Unified  Command  was  for\\nseveral  days  unable  to  mobilize  and  control  an  effective  response  to  the  loss  of  oil\\ncontainment that took place on the evening of April 8, 2000.\\n\\nThe Safety Board has previously recognized the benefits an Incident Command\\nSystem structure may provide during a pipeline spill response effort. As a result of its\\ninvestigation of the October 1994 pipeline failures on the San Jacinto River near Houston,\\nTexas,43 the Safety Board determined that implementing the Unified/Incident Command\\nstructure and operational principles in the National Response Team(cid:146)s technical assistance\\ndocument addressing Incident Command System/Unified Command enhances the overall\\npreparedness for responding to oil spills. Consequently, the Safety Board recommended\\nthat the National Response Team:\\n\\nI-96-2\\nMotivate  National  Response  Team  agencies  to  integrate  into  their  area\\ncontingency  plans  the  command  and  control  principles  contained  in  Technical\\nAssistance  Document  Incident  Command  System/Unified  Command  and\\nencourage  them  to  train  all  personnel  assigned  management  responsibilities  in\\nthose principles.\\n\\nIn a January 17, 2001, response to Safety Recommendation I-96-2, the National\\nResponse Team stated that it was working on methods to ensure that all member agencies\\nhave integrated into their area contingency plans the principles contained in the Technical\\n\\n43 National Transportation Safety Board, Evaluation of Pipeline Failures During Flooding and of Spill\\nResponse Actions, San Jacinto River Near Houston, Texas, October 1994, Pipeline Special Investigation\\nReport NTSB/SIR-96/04 (Washington, DC: NTSB, 1996).\\n\\n\\x0cAnalysis\\n\\n47\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nIncident  Command  System/Unified  Command(cid:151)Managing\\nAssistance  Document \\nResponses  to  Oil  Discharges  and  Hazardous  Substance  Releases  under  the  National\\nContingency Plan, as requested. The Safety Board classified Safety Recommendation I-\\n96-2 (cid:147)Open(cid:150)Acceptable Response,(cid:148) pending notification that the action is complete.\\n\\nThe National Response Team is made up of 16 Federal departments and agencies.\\nThe EPA is the permanent Chair of the National Response Team. Since the San Jacinto\\naccident, the EPA has distributed the Technical Assistance Document Incident Command\\nSystem/Unified  Command(cid:151)Managing  Responses  to  Oil  Discharges  and  Hazardous\\nSubstance  Releases  under  the  National  Contingency  Plan  to  all  EPA  on-scene\\ncoordinators,  and  EPA  headquarters  has  encouraged  its  regional  coordinators  to\\nincorporate the guidance from the document in their area contingency plans. Nevertheless,\\nan EPA official stated in an April 24, 2001, postaccident letter to the Safety Board that\\n(cid:147)EPA currently has no formal policy on the use of Incident Command System/Unified\\nCommand.(cid:148) The EPA has not mandated that all its regions use the Incident Command\\nSystem. Although the EPA(cid:146)s Office of Emergency and Remedial Response is developing\\nan EPA policy position on the Incident Command System, the Safety Board is concerned\\nthat no final EPA Incident Command System policy, the development of which began in\\n1996 in response to lessons learned during the 1994 San Jacinto pipeline accident, has\\nbeen completed.\\n\\nThe  lack  of  incident  command  during  the  Chalk  Point  emergency  response\\nindicates  that  the  EPA  needs  to  make  a  greater  commitment  to  incorporating  Incident\\nCommand System principles in its response procedures and to training its people more\\neffectively about the benefits provided by the use of the system. Therefore, to ensure that\\nthe necessity of an effective Incident Command System is understood by EPA responders,\\nthe  Safety  Board  believes  that  the  EPA  should  require  all  its  regions  to  integrate  the\\nprinciples  contained  in  the  National  Response  Team(cid:146)s  Technical  Assistance  Document\\nIncident  Command  System/Unified  Command(cid:151)Managing  Responses  to  Oil  Discharges\\nand  Hazardous  Substance  Releases  under  the  National  Contingency  Plan  in  their  area\\ncontingency  plans  and  require  the  regions  to  train  all  personnel  who  are  assigned\\nresponsibility to implement the plans according to those principles.\\n\\n\\x0c48\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nFindings\\n\\n1. Because Pipetronix incorrectly interpreted the results of its ultrasonic tool data for the\\npipeline feature at odometer station 53526.55, the Potomac Electric Power Company\\nwas not alerted to the need for additional evaluation of the pipe at the location where\\nit subsequently ruptured.\\n\\n2. Because  pipeline  operators  have  no  nationally  recognized  criteria  with  which  to\\nevaluate  pipe  wrinkles,  they  may  not  be  effectively  determining  whether  pipe\\ncontaining wrinkles should be allowed to remain in service.\\n\\n3. The  absence  of  effective  pipeline  monitoring  procedures  and  practices,  including\\nperiodic  line  balancing,  delayed  the  discovery  of  the  fuel  oil  shortage  on  April 7,\\n2000, which delayed the pipeline shutdown and allowed more oil to leak from the\\npipeline.\\n\\n4. Because pipeline owners and operators sometimes do not update their initial reports\\nto the National Response Center, the notifications provided to emergency responders\\nmay not always contain the complete and accurate information needed to develop an\\neffective incident response.\\n\\n5. Because  it  did  not  initially  put  a  fully  implemented  Incident  Command  System  in\\nplace, the Unified Command was for several days unable to mobilize and control an\\neffective response to the loss of oil containment that took place on the evening of\\nApril 8, 2000.\\n\\nProbable Cause\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of\\nthe  April 7,  2000,  Piney  Point  Oil  Pipeline  accident  at  the  Potomac  Electric  Power\\nCompany(cid:146)s Chalk Point, Maryland, generating station was a fracture in a buckle in the\\npipe  that  was  undiscovered  because  the  data  from  an  in-line  inspection  tool  were\\ninterpreted inaccurately as representing a T-piece. Contributing to the magnitude of the\\nfuel  oil  release  were  inadequate  operating  procedures  and  practices  for  monitoring  the\\nflow of fuel oil through the pipeline to ensure timely leak detection.\\n\\n\\x0c49\\n\\nPipeline Accident Report\\n\\nRecommendations\\n\\nAs a result of its investigation, the National Transportation Safety Board makes the\\n\\nfollowing safety recommendations:\\n\\nTo the Research and Special Programs Administration:\\n\\nEstablish  quantitative  criteria,  based  on  engineering  evaluations,  for\\ndetermining whether a wrinkle may be allowed to remain in a pipeline. (P-\\n02-01)\\n\\nRequire  pipeline  owners  and  operators  to  provide  follow-up  telephone\\nupdates  to  the  National  Response  Center  when  they  discover  that  the\\ninformation they initially reported contains significant errors or when they\\nidentify  significant  new  information  directly  related  to  the  reporting\\ncriteria. (P-02-02)\\n\\nTo the Environmental Protection Agency:\\n\\nRequire  all  your  regions  to  integrate  the  principles  contained  in  the\\nNational  Response  Team(cid:146)s  Technical  Assistance  Document  Incident\\nCommand  System/Unified  Command(cid:151)Managing  Responses \\nto  Oil\\nDischarges  and  Hazardous  Substance  Releases  under  the  National\\nContingency Plan in their area contingency plans and require the regions to\\ntrain all personnel who are assigned responsibility to implement the plans\\naccording to those principles.

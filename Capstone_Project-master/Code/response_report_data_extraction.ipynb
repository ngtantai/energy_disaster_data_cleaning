These 126 incidents included potential spills, false alarms,\\nand very minor spills for which reports were not prepared.  Techni-\\ncal and operational assistance provided to the U.S. Coast Guard for\\nspill incidents in the Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s coastal zone included 96 oil spills, 13\\nchemical spills, 11 spills of unknown material, 5 miscellaneous\\nspills, and 1 search and rescue operation.  In addition to the spills\\nlisted, NOAA assisted the U.S. Coast Guard with 54 simulation\\nexercises.\\n\\nThis volume of reports follows the format established for the Oil\\nSpill Case Histories Report prepared in 1992 by the Division with\\nU.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center support so that\\nmajor spills meeting the criteria for inclusion may be incorporated\\neasily into updated case histories reports.\\n\\n Each report in this volume is organized as follows:\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 A list of headers that summarizes the spill name; location;\\n\\nproduct; size; use  of  dispersants,  bioremediation,  and in-situ\\nburning; other special  interests; shoreline types affected; and\\nkeywords.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  A brief incident summary including weather conditions and\\n\\ndescription of the overall spill response.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  A description of the behavior of the spilled material including\\n\\nmovement, evaporation, mousse formation, and dispersion.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  A discussion of countermeasures and mitigation.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 A description of other special interest issues such as communi-\\n\\ncation problems,  unusual hazards encountered, and large\\nlosses of organisms.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2   A list of references  that document the response operations.\\n\\nAlthough the master list on the following pages includes all of the\\nincidents for which the Division provided support, only those inci-\\ndents where the pollutant actually entered the environment are\\nreported on in this volume.  These reports are abbreviated and are\\nmeant to serve only as a summary of the Division\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response to\\nrequests from Federal On-Scene Coordinators for each of the events.\\n\\nAdditional details on any of the responses may be obtained from the\\nappropriate Scientific Support Coordinator or U.S. Coast Guard\\noffice.\\n\\ni\\n\\n\\x0cSpill Report Keys\\n\\nName

fuel, went hard\\naground off West Hampton Beach two miles east of Moriches Inlet (Long Island) during an\\nearly winter storm.  The tug Hoosier State carrying 5,000 gallons of diesel, sent to pull the\\ndredge free, capsized and lost 150 to 200 gallons of hydraulic oil.  The tug \\xe2\\x80\\x98s captain was\\nkilled.\\n\\nThe weather at the time of the incident was winds from the south-southeast 30 to 40 knots\\nwith seas 8 to 12 feet. The National Weather Service forecasted diminishing winds overnight\\nto 15 to 20 knots and shifting from the south to southwest to west by morning.  An ocean\\nbuoy had recorded 21 foot seas 20 miles south of Fire Island Inlet during the afternoon of\\nNovember 28. Seas were expected to gradually decrease overnight.\\n\\nWhen the Alaska went aground,  the tide was low (0.05 feet), but the tide on the morning of\\nNovember 29 was 3.27 feet and salvage operations were effective.  The responsible party\\nremoved the dredge and salvaged the tugs involved in the incident with no loss of oil.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 1\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on November 28, 1993, by the United States Coast Guard\\n(USCG) Captain of the Port (COTP) Long Island Sound.  NOAA provided weather forecasts,\\nspill trajectory analyses, and resources-at-risk information to the COTP and notified Fire\\nIsland National Park.\\n\\nThe Scientific Support Coordinator (SSC) informed the USCG that the biggest threats were\\nto the marshes and birds inside Moriches Bay and the possibility of buried oil on the outer\\nbeaches.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.

USCG investigators identified\\nMacy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department Store, located in a mall less than one mile from the outfall, as the source\\nand responsible party.  Approximately 7,000 gallons of #4 oil had flooded the basement of\\nthe store and entered a storm sewer that flowed into Echo Bay.  Macy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s was reluctant to\\nassume responsible party status for the incident, but eventually consented to do so.\\n\\nThe USCG hired a cleanup contractor who boomed the outlet and downstream area.  Oil\\nwas contained close to the source, but some oil entered a nearby marina.\\n\\nWeather at the time of the incident was moderate, with an air temperature of 40\\xc2\\xb0F, water\\ntemperature of 49\\xc2\\xb0F, winds out of the northwest at 15 to 20 knots, and calm seas.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nThe oil was very black, emitted a lot of sheen, and readily adhered to the rocky shoreline\\nand seawall.  The shoreline in the area is mostly manmade seawall and riprap. The tide\\nrange in the bay is about seven feet, and at low tide there is an exposed tidal flat.   There was\\na \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbathtub\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ring about four-feet wide along the seawall and riprap, and oil laying on the\\nmud of the tidal flat.  The oil on the tidal flat refloated with the rising tide, but the oil\\nstranded on the seawall was well attached and not expected to be removed naturally.  There\\nwas a considerable amount of sheening.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 1\\n\\nA large quantity of oil remained in the sewer pipe and the fire department pumped water\\ninto the sewer to flush it out.  Vacuum trucks with weir skimmers were positioned at the\\noutfall to capture the flushed floating oil.  Sorbent and hard booms were strung at three\\nlocations out from the origin.  These actions proved successful; very little sheen escaped the\\ncontainment area.\\n\\nThe seawall was cleaned by high-pressure washing and manual wiping.  Sorbent boom and\\npompoms strung on the riprap were used to absorb oil released from crevasses.  Final\\ncleanup of any remaining oil was performed manually on some rocky shoreline areas and\\nfloating docks.  Open-water oil recovery was completed on December 11.\\n\\nClams and mussels were in the mudflat and attached to the seawall/riprap.  Some ducks\\nand swans were oiled, captured, and cleaned by Wildlife Rescue, Inc.   Approximately 80\\nbirds were reported oiled in the area.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nA diplomat\\xe2\\x80\\x99s residence was near the impacted area and special permission was needed to\\naccess the property to check for oiling.  Permission was granted and no oil was seen.\\n\\nSeveral local newspapers came onscene to take photographs and get first-hand accounts of\\nthe incident.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on December 6, 1993, by the USCG Marine Safety Office\\n(MSO) New York.  The SSC went onscene to perform a shoreline evaluation and give\\ncleanup recommendations.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA Hotline 141, 1 Report\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cName of Spill: \\nNOAA SSC: \\nUSCG District:\\nDate of Spill: \\nLocation of Spill: \\nLatitude: \\nLongitude: \\nSpilled Material: \\nSpilled Material Type: \\nAmount: \\nSource of Spill: \\nResources at Risk: \\n\\nDispersants: \\nBioremediation: \\nIn-situ Burning:\\nOther Special Interest: \\nShoreline Types Impacted:  \\n\\nKeywords: \\n\\nIncident Summary:\\n\\nUSCG District 1\\n\\nBouchard 35\\nEd Levine\\n1\\n01/05/94\\nEast River, New York\\n40\\xc2\\xb048\\xe2\\x80\\x99N\\n73\\xc2\\xb048\\xe2\\x80\\x99W\\nunleaded gasoline\\n1\\n100 barrels\\nbarge\\nBirds: gulls, wintering areas\\nRecreation: marinas, boat ramps\\nResource Extraction: power plant water intakes,\\nindustrial water  intakes\\nN\\nN\\nN\\nnone\\ncoastal structures, consolidated seawalls, consolidated\\nshores, mixed sediment beaches, piers,  riprap\\nevaporation\\n\\nAt  1730  January 5, 1994, the barge Bouchard 35 collided with its tug Evening Tide in the East\\nRiver near the Whitestone Bridge at the western end of Long Island Sound.

The barge was carrying 17,000 barrels of unleaded gasoline and\\napproximately 100 barrels were lost. The crack was above the waterline and was\\nsuccessfully plugged within a few hours of the incident.\\n\\nWeather onscene was winds from the west at 20 to 25 knots, air temperature 21\\xc2\\xb0F, water\\ntemperature 35\\xc2\\xb0F, and one- to two-foot seas.\\n\\nThe USCG dispatched two boats to survey the incident. An Alco-Sensor test was\\nadministered to barge and tug personnel; results were negative.  The USCG established a\\nsafety zone between the Whitestone and Throggs Neck bridges. Environmentally sensitive\\nareas and water intakes were identified.  No oil was seen on the water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface during an\\noverflight the next morning.\\n\\nBehavior of  Spilled Material:\\n\\nSince the spill occurred during the night, no reports of slicks were received.  However,\\nreports of gasoline odors were recorded by USCG personnel onscene.  The  spill was\\nexpected to remain between the two bridges and dissipate/evaporate overnight.  Due to the\\nelevation of the bridges over the water, no explosion or fire hazard existed.   New York City\\nFire Department personnel in a boat onscene concurred with this assessment.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 1\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nNotifications were made to water intakes.  The barge was boomed by cleanup contractor\\npersonnel. No recovery efforts were attempted.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on January 5, 1994, by the USCG MSO New York who\\nrequested a trajectory analysis and fate and effects of gasoline.   The SSC told the Federal\\nOn-Scene Coordinator (FOSC) that 90 percent evaporation/dissolution would occur within\\nfour hours and any remaining oil would have a tidal excursion of  one and a half and two\\nmiles and stay within the area bounded by the two bridges.  The SSC advised that most of\\nthe shoreline in the area is manmade and harbor structures, with several areas of mixed\\ngrain and sand beaches.  There are two islands containing bird nesting areas just outside the\\narea of anticipated impacts.  NOAA supported this incident by phone and facsimile for\\nseveral hours.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.  ADIOS\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 (Automated Data Inquiry for oil Spills) User\\'s Manual.

The 202-foot Cynthia\\nM, with a capacity of 340,000 gallons, was loaded with 310,000 gallons of a 30-percent\\nsolution of caustic soda.  Her list was suspected to have been caused by open valves that\\nallowed free communication of liquids between internal tanks.\\n\\nThe weather onscene was winds from the southwest at 15 to 20 knots.  The tidal excursions\\nfor the Hackensack River were estimated to be between three-quarters of a mile and one\\nmile.\\n\\nThe port side of the barge was completely submerged from center line to rail, resting solidly\\non the bottom.  The USCG, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection and\\nEnergy, and New Jersey Marine Police went to the scene and assessed the situation.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 1\\n\\nInitially, the capsizing of the vessel and its subsequent loss of cargo were the greatest\\nconcerns.  On March 16 it was estimated that approximately 150,000 gallons of cargo had\\nbeen lost into the Hackensack River and Newark Bay.  The caustic soda escaped from a vent\\non deck that had submerged because of the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list.  At 1235 water testing of pH near\\nthe barge showed readings of 12; by 1535 the readings were 9, indicating that pH was\\nreturning to normal levels.\\n\\nThe responsible party hired a marine salvor to raise the barge, and state and federal agencies\\nmonitored the water pH until it returned to normal.\\n\\nThe USCG was onscene about two weeks monitoring the spill response and salvage.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nThe caustic soda dissolved into the water causing sheening, like heat on a road surface\\ncauses waving of images.  Only areas in the immediate vicinity of the barge were impacted.\\n\\nThe vessel reportedly lost her entire cargo, 310,000 gallons of caustic soda.  No recovery was\\npossible because the chemical immediately dissolved when it went into the water.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nProp wash from boats maneuvered in the area was used to enhance mixing and dilution and\\nwater pH was monitored.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident at 0735 on March 15, 1994, by the USCG.  The SSC told\\nthe responders that sodium hydroxide (liquid) was heavier than water and would dissolve\\nin water, producing heat.  It is also corrosive to metals and tissue (skin); therefore,\\nprotection of personnel must be considered.  Immediate environmental concerns of the\\npollutant entering the water were a localized fish kill, possible impacts on birds, and the\\ndestruction of marsh habitat.  The addition of a weak acid to neutralize the pH balance was\\nconsidered.  NOAA recommended the use of prop wash or fire hoses to increase dilution of\\nthe plume and help mix the chemical into the water column.\\n\\nNOAA supported the response for one day.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA. 1993.

The release occurred during an internal fuel transfer when the\\nvessel overfilled a tank. Oil was discharged until about 0430 when the mistake was\\ndiscovered. Oil spread along the East River.\\n\\nOn the day of the release the weather was 72\\xc2\\xb0F, visibility about eight miles, winds at five\\nknots from the south, and calm seas.\\n\\nThe responsible party notified the USCG and cleanup contractors. The vessel moored in\\nFlushing Bay (near LaGuardia Airport) and was circled with sorbent boom.\\n\\nThe USCG sent out a Pollution Investigation Team in vessels and on several overflights.

The oil was\\nreleased on an ebb tide and during the subsequent flood tide was forced through Hell Gate\\n(with very strong currents). Turbulent mixing caused much of the oil to dissipate. The\\nADIOS weathering model predicted over 70 percent combined dissolution and evaporation\\nwithin the first 24 hours. However, real-world observations suggest that the actual rate was\\nmuch higher due to the warm weather and turbulent mixing.\\n\\nThe entire length of the East River was affected.\\n\\nOf the approximately 8,000 gallons of oil discharged, none was recovered. The entire slick\\nwas allowed to naturally evaporate and dissipate.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nSeveral environmentally sensitive areas were identified in the New York Area Plan;\\nhowever, no protection strategies were deployed due to the rapid dissipation of the product.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nNo wildlife impacts were reported.\\n\\nDuring the initial release, the odor of the fuel oil was quite noticeable along the river, but\\ndue to the rapid reduction in concentration, this soon became unimportant. No reports were\\nreceived by the USCG, probably due to the early hour of the release. Effects to human health\\nand safety were not an issue.\\n\\nMedia interest was light. However, there was a report on National Public Radio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s national\\nnews edition that evening.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nThe NOAA SSC was notified and asked to provide trajectory analysis and oil weathering\\npredictions. By consulting the Shio Tide Program, viewing tidal currents in the area, and\\ntime of release, the SSC predicted oil extending from Governors Island up the East River\\npast Wards Island. The ADIOS run for #2 fuel oil predicted 70 percent loss due to combined\\nevaporation and dissipation. The SSC reported results to the Command Post and was\\nfurther requested to go onscene to  assess the situation. Observations from a USCG vessel\\nshowed oil rapidly spreading and dissipating.

The power plant is approximately two miles downriver\\nof the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit.  The leak was continuous and occurred from\\napproximately 2230 on February 9 to 0330 on February 10 and was described as flowing at\\nthe rate of a fire-hose discharge.  Oil had broken through a corroded portion of a 10-inch\\nsupply line, ran into a storm sewer, and then traveled about 100 feet to enter the river.\\nWhen the incident occurred, the Detroit River was 95 percent ice-covered.\\n\\nOriginally the released product was thought to be a #6 oil, but laboratory analysis proved it\\nwas a #4 fuel with density of 0.93.  The original estimate of 10,000 to 30,000 gallons proved\\na conundrum as only about 300 gallons was observed in the river.  Later volume refinements\\nhad the number at officially less than 900 gallons and most likely around 300 gallons.  The\\nCity of Detroit assumed responsibility for the spill and immediately hired Marine Pollution\\nControl.  Only a limited response was possible due to the ice.  A portion of the spilled oiled\\nwas recovered by removing the oil-stained ice accessible from the shorelines.  The Detroit\\nCity Laboratory performed the first analysis on the oil, determining that it was a #4 rather\\nthan a #6, and that it was a \"floater.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The City immediately hired Tri-State Bird Rescue to\\nassess the threat to nearly 5000 birds in the oiled area and to establish a rehabilitation\\ncenter, if necessary.\\n\\nThe Joint U.S./Canada contingency plan was invoked and a unified command was formed\\namong the USCG, the City of Detroit, the State of Michigan, and the Canadian Coast Guard\\n(CCG).  All activities took place at the MSO Detroit office.\\n\\nThe active response lasted for only four days.  On the fifth and sixth days, the temperature\\nrose into the 40s and the wind shifted to from the east allowing more of the oil-stained ice\\nto migrate to the shoreline where it could be removed.  The increased temperatures caused\\nan ice jam that flushed all the remaining oiled ice down the Trenton Channel into still-frozen\\nLake Erie.   Only two oiled birds died as a result of the spill.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 2/9\\n\\nThe major factors controlling the movement and the behavior of the oil were the ice on the\\nDetroit River and the continuous release over approximately five hours.  The majority of the\\noil was captured in the broken ice matrix that became concentrated at the Dingle Park ice\\njam.  Oil making it through the ice jam caused considerable sheening and some shoreline ice\\nstaining along the entire eastern channel and banks of the Detroit River.  Most impacted\\nareas were the industrialized shorelines along the river because the Dingle Park ice jam kept\\nmost of the oil from moving south to the more sensitive bird habitat shorelines of the\\nsouthern Detroit River.  An estimated 300 to 400 gallons of product were actually released,\\napproximately half of which was recovered by working with sorbents and ice-lifting cranes\\nfrom the shoreline.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nOnce discovered the pipeline feeding the spill was immediately shut down and a boom was\\nplaced around the river outfall.  Due to the heavy ice coverage, no open-water recovery was\\npossible and all recovery operations were from the shoreline.  Being highly industrialized,\\nthe river was reasonably accessible from the shoreline, and the contractor crane lifted much\\nof the oil-stained ice into large plastic totes.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe municipal water intake, which was about five miles downstream from the spill source,\\nwas initially closed by the City of Detroit.  After the laboratory analysis indicated that the\\noil was a \"floater\" and it was determined that the eight-foot deep intake would not be\\nthreatened, the intake was reopened.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on February 9, 1994, and the SSC arrived onscene\\nFebruary 11.  NOAA participated in daily overflights charting locations of the oil and the\\nice.  Daily weather reports were provided.   NOAA provided oil sample analysis that, after\\na weather delay in shipping, confirmed the results of the Detroit laboratory.   The City of\\nDetroit sought NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice regarding the reopening of the water intake facility.  NOAA\\nattended all informational and strategic meetings.  The SSC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s advice was actively sought\\nthroughout the four-day duration of NOAA support.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA Hotline 149, 7 reports\\n\\nResearch Planning Institute.  1985.

USCG MSO Cleveland determined the source to be the sunken\\nbarge Cleveco.  Records indicated that the 260-foot barge sank during a blizzard in December\\n1942.  The barge was in tow from Toledo, Ohio to Cleveland, Ohio carrying 1,013,325\\ngallons of #6 fuel oil.  In 1961, the Army Corps of Engineers supervised a salvage operation\\nto raise the barge from its original location, move it clear of the shipping lanes, and resink it\\nin 70 feet of water.  Records show that the barge, currently resting keel up, could still\\ncontain up to 800,000 gallons of product in five of her six tanks.  The COTP federalized the\\nincident after divers observed an ounce of oil leaking out of a one and a half inch valve\\nevery 13 minutes.  This leak was plugged on July 16 and an inspection of all exposed valves\\non the hull was conducted.  These valves were installed in the hull during the initial salvage\\nin 1961 to pump air into the tanks in order to raise the barge.\\n\\nThe U.S. Navy Supervisor of Salvage (NAVSUPSAL) was requested to oversee the\\noperations to determine how much oil remained on the barge.  These operations began on\\nAugust 8 and ran until August 17.  Divers drilled into the hull and sounded the five tanks\\nusing various methods.  Oil was found in tanks 2 through 6.  No oil was found in the\\nforepeak tank or in tank 1.  Samples of the sediment on each side of the barge were also\\nobtained to determine if any oil from the barge had contaminated the lake bottom.  No oil\\nwas observed in these samples.  Oil recovery and containment equipment were onscene for\\nimmediate action if there was a release of oil during the operations.  Weather constraints\\nand equipment difficulties caused some delays during these operations.\\n\\nIn early September sheens were again observed near the barge.  A diver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation\\ndetermined that a small crack had developed in one of the valves and around a weld seam\\nin the hull.  These were patched and no other oil was observed leaking from the barge.\\nAdditional sheens observed were attributed to the release of oil clinging to the hull from the\\nprevious NAVSUPSAL operations.\\n\\nNAVSUPSAL presented the volumetric analysis and salvage report to the COTP MSO\\nCleveland on November 9.  They recommended future salvage and oil recovery operations.\\nThese recommendations included entombing the hull in an impermeable shell, raising the\\nbarge, and leaving the barge in place and pumping off the remaining oil.  It was decided that\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 2/9\\n\\nthe best course of action would be to remove the oil in place and a statement of work and\\nrequest for bids is being prepared.  Operations for the recovery of the oil from the barge  are\\nexpected to begin in July 1995.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on July 14, 1994.  Planning began immediately for a\\nworst-case release of the product.  A meeting with local, state, and federal resource agencies\\nwas held where it was determined that before any underwater survey operations were\\nbegun, a detailed response strategy plan would be developed.  At this meeting the SSC\\nprovided oil spill risk maps designed to give a relative risk profile for oil beaching at\\nselected spots along the shore.  The maps also provided rough estimates of arrival time from\\na release of the submerged fuel oil.  These maps, based on climatological wind data for\\ncentral Lake Erie, were used as a basis to determine the need for protection strategies for\\nareas at risk.\\n\\nEnvironmentally and economically sensitive areas from Lake Erie islands to the west and\\nthe Ohio/Pennsylvania shoreline to the east were identified by an ad hoc committee of\\nUSCG, NOAA, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Ohio Environmental Protection\\nAgency (OHEPA) and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS).  The SSC and personnel\\nfrom OHEPA conducted two overflights on USCG H-65 helicopters to assess these areas.\\nThe SSC and the Assistant Port Operations Officer from the MSO also conducted site visits\\nto the areas considered at highest risk to identify detailed protection strategies.  On\\nrecommendations from this committee containment boom was pre-staged throughout the\\nzone and the USCG Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System (VOSS) was moved to\\nCleveland.\\n\\nNOAA provided weather forecasts during periods of on-water operations.\\n\\nThe SSC attended several meetings during the planning of dive operations and provided\\ninformation to the USCG on diving in hazardous environments.  NOAA helped analyze the\\nrecommendations from NAVSUPSAL on recovery of the sunken oil.  A sample of the oil\\nwas analyzed to confirm that the oil was #6 fuel oil.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNational Climatic Center.  1990.  Climatic Summaries for NDBC Buoys and Stations\\nUpdate 1.

At 1400 the USCG initiated an\\nassessment of the U.S. shoreline along the Detroit River.  A vehicle was dispatched to the\\nRouge River for a shoreline investigation.  The USCG set up a command post at MSO\\nDetroit and contacted local, state, and federal agencies.  Michigan Department of Natural\\nResources (MDNR) was designated by the Michigan State Police as the lead state agency for\\nthe investigation.  After the USCG discovered similar material in the Rouge River, the CCG\\nrequested that the USCG invoke the U.S./Canada Great Lakes Contingency Plan.\\n\\nThe U.S. EPA assumed the lead as FOSC after being notified by the USCG that the incident\\nmight involve an inland-based facility.  The EPA opened the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund\\nand contracted Marine Pollution Control to investigate and respond to the reported material\\nin the Detroit River system.  No recoverable material was detected the next day and efforts\\nwere focused on investigating potential sources.  MDNR was the lead agency for this\\ninvestigation.  Samples were collected from the Canadians for analysis and possible\\nfingerprinting.\\n\\nA Unified Command structure was set up and joint operations were undertaken between all\\nU.S. and Canadian agencies.\\n\\nBy Friday, August 19, 80 percent of the Canadian shoreline had been cleaned.  Further\\ncontamination, however, was possible as some of the floating product was still being driven\\nashore by southwest winds.  Shoreline assessment and cleanup activities continued through\\nthe weekend.\\n\\nOn Monday, August 22, cleanup was nearly complete.  Additional overflights and shoreline\\nassessments by the USCG and MDNR showed no contamination of the U.S. shoreline.\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 2/9\\n\\nInvestigations by MDNR into potential responsible parties led them to focus on the Hubbell-\\nSouthfield municipal outfall as the possible source.  Since fingerprinting the material was\\ndifficult and the outfall serviced a very large geographic area, it was reasoned that\\ndetermining the responsible party would be very difficult.  It was also surmised that the\\nmaterial could have built up on the walls of the outfall over time and been released during\\nthe combined sewer overflow event during the previous weekend storms.\\n\\nOn August 25, after holding a final U.S./Canada meeting, the response to the incident was\\nconcluded.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nThe material released was a non-homogenous substance consisting of a white greasy solid\\ndescribed as animal fat or tallow.  The substance also contained materials such as hair,\\nhuman waste, and solid garbage and had a strong odor.  The material floated.  The pieces\\nranged from pea- to football-sized.  One large piece weighed more than 100 pounds.\\n\\nThe solid, dirty-white material began washing up on the Canadian shoreline late on Sunday,\\nAugust 14, after a strong frontal passage with associated heavy rains passed through the\\nDetroit metropolitan area on Saturday.  The material was released into the Rouge and\\nDetroit rivers.  Strong west winds were responsible for pushing the material towards the\\neastern shoreline of the river.  A counterclockwise gyre at the mouth of the Detroit River\\ncontributed to the shoreline impacts along the northern shore of western Lake Erie.\\nSouthwest winds contributed to the fouling of the shoreline throughout the next week.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe material was manually removed and bagged for disposal as it beached.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe origin of the animal fat and waste was believed to have been from within one or more\\nmunicipal outfalls.  It was surmised that the material built up on the walls of the outfall(s)\\nover time and may have broken free during an unusually large release of the combined sewer\\noverflow during a heavy rainstorm.\\n\\nPathfinder model runs in hindcast mode accurately predicted where the material beached.\\n\\nSampling and fingerprinting the animal fat material was very difficult.  Due to the lack of\\nhomogeneity of the material and unknown human health risks, several popular Canadian\\nbeaches were closed during a holiday weekend to accommodate cleanup operations.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on August 17, 1994, by the Environment Canada\\nRegional Environmental Emergencies Coordinator.   The CCG and Environment Canada had\\nbeen responding to this incident since Sunday afternoon when the animal fat material began\\nwashing up on the beaches.  When attempts to locate a Canadian source were unsuccessful,\\na U.S. source was suspected.  Environment Canada asked the SSC to run the Pathfinder\\ntrajectory model in hindcast mode to determine the source of the pollutant.  The SSC\\ncontacted the USCG to provide this information to them and to indicate a willingness to\\nassist in the response.   Once it was determined that the pollutant was emanating from the\\nRiver Rouge area the EPA took over as FOSC.  The SSC provided trajectory information,\\nweather forecasts, resource at risk information, and health and safety concerns to Canadian\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 2/9\\n\\nand American officials.   NOAA also provided guidance to Environment Canada on\\nfingerprinting the pollutant and the inherent difficulties of this activity.\\n\\nThe SSC remained in contact with the FOSC and Environment Canada by phone and fax\\nthroughout the event.  NOAA support continued for approximately five days.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA Hotline 162, 5 Reports.\\n\\nResearch Planning, Inc.,  August 17, 1994.

By October 17 it became clear that the\\nrelease of fuel oil from the sunken F/V Helen Euphane was complicated by 100 gallons of\\npaint and 20 gallons of lube oil stored onboard.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nBy October 17 the vessel was boomed; however, strong currents and subsequent\\nentrainment caused considerable sheen outside the boom area.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nOn October 17 USCG Station Ocean City deployed an additional 500 feet of ocean boom\\naround the vessel to prevent loss of more oil into the surrounding environment.  By October\\n18 the contractor began to dewater the vessel to allow access to fuel tank fill lines so that the\\ntanks could be stripped and the waste oil and slop removed from inside the containment\\narea.  On November 8 the paint, paint cans, 55-gallon drums of oil, and oil-saturated\\nsorbents were removed from the vessel.  More than 20 drums of sorbent and oil-soaked\\nmaterials were removed from the vessel.  The vessel had been temporarily refloated to\\nconduct this level of cleanup; however, on November 16 it sank to the bottom and was\\nsurrounded by containment boom.  No pollution was seen within this boomed area.\\n\\nNOAA Activities: \\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on November 8, 1993, by MSO Baltimore and\\nparticipated with the MSO staff by telephone during discussions with the State of Maryland\\non when cleanup operations could be stopped on the F/V Helen Euphane.

The processing tank failure resulted in a release of cyclohexane into Gravelly Creek, a\\ntributary of the James River.  The potential amount of the release was 5,400 pounds.\\n\\nBehavior of Material:\\n\\nApproximately 600 gallons of cyclohexane was believed to have entered Gravelly Creek; the\\nremainder of the release was pooled around the processing tank.  Cyclohexane is a\\nflammable liquid solvent used for lacquers, resins, paints, varnishes, and as a paint remover.\\nIt is insoluble in water.  Some of the cyclohexane moved and mixed within the water column\\nin Gravelly Creek towards the James River.  The sampling plan showed that on the first day\\nof the incident concentrations of cyclohexane entering the James River did not exceed 50\\nparts per million.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nAllied\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Facility Response Team contained the remaining material in the processing tank,\\nstopping any further release.  The response team then removed the spilled material from the\\nground at the tank site with vacuum systems and sorbent pads.  The amount of cyclohexane\\nthat entered Gravelly Creek and mixed into the water column could not be removed\\nmanually.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nEffects on human health and safety downriver of the chemical release were considered by\\nthe emergency response team to be negligible because of the small quantity that had entered\\nthe James River at Gravelly Creek.  This estimate was based on technical discussions\\nbetween Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the assembled group and was confirmed by\\nsampling results.  Similarly, immediate effects on wildlife were considered minimal\\ndownriver from the actual spill location.  No wildlife injuries or fish kills were reported as a\\nresult of this release.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\n45\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nNOAA was notified on November 9, 1993, by MSO Hampton Roads and participated at the\\nUnified Command established at the MSO in Norfolk.   As part of this team, NOAA\\ncontacted the CDC to coordinate discussions on the effects to human health and safety from\\nthe release of cyclohexane.  This material has approximately the same vapor pressure as\\ngasoline and would evaporate and dissolve into the water column.  MSO Hampton Roads\\nreviewed the sampling plan developed by Allied Signal  to determine whether additional\\nrecovery actions should be directed.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nBudavari, S., M. J.

The oil was traced back through the city\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sewer system approximately eight blocks\\nwhere the oil sheen stopped.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe oil was contained in the sewer system by placing boom at the outfall on the Lafayette\\nRiver and establishing an underflow dam  with resources of the City of Norfolk.  Incoming\\ntide held the oil at the mouth of the outfall and drove some of the oil into the sewer system.\\nVery little oil entered the Lafayette River.  The USCG and their contractor had containment\\nin place before the tide changed.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nMSO personnel, the NOAA SSC, and City of Norfolk personnel coordinated efforts and\\nagreed to have an underflow dam system constructed at the mouth of the outfall to act as a\\ncollection point for the oil.  The City of Norfolk provided the resources to construct the\\nunderflow dam while the USCG contractor, IMS, removed the oil material using a vacuum\\ntruck and sorbent booms and pads.  Using these containment systems IMS removed more\\nthan 3,500 gallons of waste oil and water on the first day and over 500 gallons of oily\\nmaterial on the second day.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nA similar mystery spill impacted this area of the port approximately two months before this\\nincident.\\n\\nMSO Hampton Roads investigators traced the sewer system to a tank cleaning operation\\neight blocks from the outfall.

While attempting to move the M/V Saudi Diriyah, she gashed the port side\\nof the vessel tied up at Lamberts Point Dock.  The tug reported that heavy black oil was\\ncoming out of the hole. The ruptured tank had a potential capacity of 42,000 gallons of #4\\noil.  By 0127 December 2 MSO monitors reported that oil was no longer coming from the\\nvessel.  The vessel was boomed off by 0315.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nNo. 4 fuel oil is essentially a mix of #2 and #6 fuel oils.  Approximately 20 to 30 percent of\\nthe product evaporated over the first few days, leaving a highly viscous (>10,000 centistokes\\n[cst]) residue.  Tide levels were going from spring to neap, so each high tide was a little\\nlower and the stranded oil was not completely refloated.\\n\\nOn the first day, the oil was transported about three miles downstream and the easterly\\ncomponent of the wind shifted a major portion of the oil toward the western side of the\\nriver.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nAn overflight was conducted at 0900 December 3 by the NOAA SSC and a representative of\\nthe vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner.  At that time, two extensive oil pooling areas existed in the South Branch\\nElizabeth River:  one near the entrance, the other just north of the Railroad Bridge.  These\\nconsisted of light sheen and mousse.  Additional spotty light sheen was observed in the\\nSouth Branch south of the Railroad Bridge.  Light sheen and mousse were observed in the\\nEast Branch.  Spotty light sheen was observed in the West Branch.  Light sheen was visible\\nnear the southeast corner of Craney Island, and light sheen and mousse were observed in\\nthe channel near the Coal Terminal.  Streamers of light sheen were visible at Moon Research\\n(Port Norfolk).  Some streamers of light sheen were also observed near the entrance to Scott\\nCreek.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\n49\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nResources at Risk:  Most of the shoreline along the Elizabeth River is developed, dominated\\nby seawalls and riprap structures.  However, along the side rivers and creeks, the shoreline\\nis dominated by fringing marshes.  There are few tidal flats.  The biological resources\\nidentified at greatest risk were birds, especially wading birds (such as herons and egrets)\\nand waterfowl.  There was a heron nesting area at Algonquin Park, inside the Highway 337\\nbridge over the Lafayette River.  Wintering waterfowl were present throughout the area,\\nthough they were more likely to be in the more open areas than the restricted channels.\\nOverflights observed and reported the distribution and number of waterfowl near slicks or\\nin adjacent areas threatened by slicks.\\n\\nProtection Priorities:  The Lafayette River and Craney Island Creek were identified as\\nprotection priorities.  These were areas of extensive wetlands and bird use.  Lafayette River\\nalso has a heron nesting area. The western branch of the Elizabeth River was the next\\npriority, because it had the more extensive wetlands and tidal flats.  Although there were\\nfringing marshes throughout the area, there were some areas with extensive marshes,\\nincluding the northern shoreline at the entrance to the Lafayette River, the embayment\\nadjacent to Virginia Gardens, and up the river beyond the second bridge crossing.  Of\\ngreatest concern were the large numbers of wintering waterfowl in the region, the most\\nsince 1985.  There were specific areas where these waterfowl were concentrated:\\n\\np\\n\\np\\n\\nAt the entrance to the Lafayette River at Julian\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Neck, where residents feed them,\\nwere 300 to 500 canvasbacks, scaups, widgeon, and mallards;\\n\\nAt Craney Island Creek;\\n\\np More than 500 mallards were located in the South Branch of the Elizabeth River at\\n\\nJones Creek where ducks feed on spillage from grain elevators; and\\n\\np\\n\\nUp the Western Branch of the Elizabeth River, near Lilly Creek, were buffleheads,\\ncanvasbacks, mallards, and other species.\\n\\nMost of these waterfowl were diving ducks that spend most of their time on the water.\\nThey were difficult to capture because they dove when approached.  The exception is the\\nmallard, a dabbling duck.  NOAA identified these waterfowl as a priority for protection.\\n\\nDuring this spill event, 7 oiled seagulls were reported and reports of 10 to 15 more oiled\\nseagulls were not confirmed.  The Science Museum at Virginia Beach agreed to collect and\\ntreat oiled animals.\\n\\nNOAA Activities: \\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on December 1, 1993, by MSO Hampton Roads and\\nparticipated on-scene with the MSO staff as a member of the Unified Command.  NOAA\\nremained on-scene for nearly a week as a participant in both the planning staff and with the\\nOSC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Command Staff.  NOAA provided the OSC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staff management services, including\\nvisuals of the trajectory of the spilled oil; weather forecasting and planning; on-scene\\nobservations of the spilled oil, including visuals; coordinated decisions on planning and\\nresponding to oiled wildlife; and interface with the scientific community.\\n\\nNOAA conducted a meeting December 3 to discuss plans for shoreline evaluation when the\\noil made landfall.  Shoreline evaluation techniques were to be taught to six Shoreline\\nEvaluation Teams.  The tasks of these teams were to determine:\\n\\np where there is oil on the shoreline;\\n\\n50\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\np if there is enough oil for the contractor to pick up; and\\n\\np if there is oiling that will require further assessment.\\n\\nOn December 4, NOAA helped the USCG and the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner train the Shoreline\\nEvaluation Teams. Topics for the training included proper completion of the Shoreline\\nEvaluation Forms, standards for marking the status/operations maps, and site safety.  The\\nteams categorized the oiled shoreline by four criteria:\\n\\n1. Oil observed, cleanup action required;\\n\\n2. No oil observed, no cleanup action required;\\n\\n3. Oil observed, requires further assessment; and\\n\\n4. Oil observed, cleanup not practical/possible.\\n\\nFollowing the training the teams were dispatched to begin their evaluation in the harbor.\\nTwo of the teams performed the surveys from small boats in the East and South branches of\\nthe Elizabeth River.  In the South Branch between the entrance and the Railroad Bridge, a 6-\\nto 10-inch band of oil began at the entrance and extended south for one mile along the\\nwestern side on the bulkhead, then continued another mile along the eastern side of the\\nfacilities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 piers and bulkheads.  This oil required cleanup contractor removal.  There were\\napproximately ten additional isolated locations identified for contractor cleanup outside the\\nSouth Branch area.\\n\\nThree areas were identified by the teams as sites requiring a more detailed assessment:\\n\\n1. Bayview Beach, an erosional sandy beach in the City of Portsmouth;\\n\\n2. Tidewater Yacht Basin; and\\n\\n3. An inlet in the City of Chesapeake on the eastern side of the South Branch (the site of\\n\\na gasoline spill two weeks prior).\\n\\nOn December 5, NOAA, USCG, USCG Strike Team, City of Portsmouth, vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner,\\nCommonwealth of Virginia, and Old Dominion University conducted a detailed shoreline\\nassessment of the three areas.  They made the following observations and recommendations:\\n\\n1. Bayview Boulevard Marsh Site\\n\\nThis area had a broken 6- to 12-inch wide band (approximately 90 percent coverage)\\nfor 300 to 400 yards at the high-tide line.  At the west end of the beach under the\\nbridge (Culpepper Rentals), the oil was thicker, 1-meter wide band (80 to 90 percent\\ncoverage).  Farther west in Hull Creek, marsh grasses were oiled.  The\\nrecommendation to the City of Portsmouth and vessel owner was to have an\\nenvironmental wetlands specialist determine the area of the oiled marsh grass at this\\nsite.  If the oil causes a loss of marsh grass and affects the stability of this erosional\\nbeach, the grass may need to be replanted later.  The Commonwealth of Virginia\\nrequested that this site become a higher priority for cleanup.\\n\\n2. Tidewater Yacht Basin Site\\n\\n51\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nThe assessment team observed only bulkhead oiling and some oiled sandy beach at\\nthis location.  No oiled marsh grasses were observed.  No additional\\nrecommendation was made.\\n\\n3. Chesapeake Marsh Inlet Site\\n\\nThis inlet is located between the Crown and Mobil Oil terminals on the eastern side\\nof the South Branch.  Oiled fringing marshes were observed; however, during their\\ninvestigation, the team noted that the wind (gusting to 30 knots) and high-tide were\\nwashing the marsh.  They recommended that no cleanup be done within the marsh\\nproper, but that loose oil on the adjacent beaches should be removed.\\n\\nNOAA discussed \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow-clean-is-clean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d issues and the process for determining when the\\ncleanup would be completed.  Documents prepared for the recent spill in Tampa, Florida\\n(August 1993) concerning criteria for cleaned sandy beaches, seawalls, and other manmade\\nstructures were also provided for consideration.  Based upon these documents and\\nconferences, representatives from the Commonwealth of Virginia, the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner,\\nUSCG, and NOAA completed a planning document that helped document \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow clean is\\nclean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for this incident.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nVirginia Institute of Marine Science. 1980.

The source of the spill could have been a release of\\noil into the Cape Fear River on December 10, 1993, from the tug Dolphin.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nOil was trapped in the sewer system (the sewer system was tidally influenced) by high\\nwesterly winds and an incoming tide.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nHard and sorbent booms were placed around the storm drain outfall.  The City of\\nWilmington Fire Department attempted to flush the oil out of the storm sewer system by\\nforcing high-pressure water into the sewer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s updrain of the outfall.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nOn December 15 the idea that the source of this spill was not from the storm sewer, but from\\na diesel spill into the Cape Fear River that then flowed into the sewer system, became an\\nactive subject of investigation.

At about 0200, March 22 the vessel notified the USCG that\\noil was leaking from a crack on the port side of the forward fuel tank.  The release rate was\\ndescribed as similar to the flow from a garden hose.  The crack was near the anchor hawse\\npipe, about 20 to 30 feet above the waterline.   At the time of the notification, an estimated\\n130,000 gallons of fuel oil had been loaded in the tank above the crack.  The leak slowed to a\\ntrickle by late morning.  Estimates of the amount of oil in the water ranged from 1,300\\ngallons to 12,500 gallons.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nOn the night of March 21, #6 fuel oil spilled from the M/V Isomeria into the South Branch of\\nthe Elizabeth River near the confluence of St. Julian Creek.  Observers on a USCG overflight\\nnoted that the southern extent of the floating oil was at the Gilmerton Bridge and the\\nnorthern extent was at green buoy 15, just north of a large concrete plant.  The tidal\\nexcursion in this area is typically about two miles.  Boom was put into place at the\\nGilmerton Bridge, the mouth of Milldam Creek, and the mouth of St. Julian Creek.  Winds\\nhad driven much of the oil to the west bank of the South Branch of the Elizabeth River.\\n\\nThere had been strong north-northeast winds overnight and thunderstorms in the area.  On\\nthe first day of the incident winds backed to the northwest, and continued to back to the\\nwest, and on the second day backed to the southwest.\\n\\nIt was expected that this oil spill would be very similar to a spill four months earlier, even\\nthough it was a heavier type of oil.  The Isomeria\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil was more viscous and sticky, and less\\nlikely to sheen early in the spill.  During the falling tides the oil coated shoreline structures\\nand marsh vegetation; however, on the next rising tide the oil was lifted from the substrate.\\nThe oil accumulated in thick bands at the high-tide line.  The tide during this period was\\nmoving toward spring conditions, so the high tides were increasing in height each day.  In\\nsome locations the oil stranded higher with each tide.\\n\\n69\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nShell Oil Company acted as the spill manager for the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner.  In this role, Shell hired\\nIMS as their primary contractor, and hired several other oil-spill contractors to maximize the\\nresources they could apply to this response.\\n\\nThe large response staff used harbor  boom to protect St. Julian Creek and to hold the oil\\nalong the west shoreline of the Elizabeth River.  Sorbent boom and sorbent pads were used\\nto contain and remove the oil where possible.  Around the Isomeria the contractors deployed\\nseveral layers of boom and used vacuum trucks to remove the contained oil.  Sorbents were\\nalso used to remove the oil that had been collected in an abandoned canal that was behind\\nthe pier used by the Isomeria.  Hand equipment was used to remove stranded oil from the\\nshoreline.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe biological resource at greatest risk from this heavy oil spill was birds, especially\\nwaterfowl.  At that time of year, large numbers of both wintering and migratory waterfowl\\nwere likely to be seen throughout the area.  Ducks concentrated at Jones Creek where they\\nfeed on  spillage from grain elevators.  Old Dominion University staff was also contacted to\\nidentify other concentration areas being used that week.  Wading birds such as herons and\\negrets could have been present along mud flats and marsh habitats, where they can feed\\nalong the shoreline edge. Crabs were buried in muddy river and creek bottoms, or in deep\\nwater.  Shellfish and finfish resources were at low activity levels during the response and\\nwere at minimal risk of exposure to #6 fuel oil.\\n\\nMost resources were concentrated up side creeks rather than in the main river channel; thus\\nSt. Julians Creek was the highest priority for protection.  There are four water intakes in the\\nSouth Branch (Virginia Power South Branch Intake and three locations of wells owned by\\nTarmac Mid-Atlantic Inc.).  Other intakes identified were located along the main stem and\\nwestern branch of the Elizabeth River.\\n\\nNeither the Isomeria nor the facility, Atlantic Energy, was required to have oil spill response\\nplans.  However, the use of the spill management team by Shell Oil  brought a skilled and\\naggressive response organization that interacted efficiently with the spill management team\\nestablished by MSO Hampton Roads by the end of the first day.\\n\\nNOAA Activities: \\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on March 21, 1994, by MSO Hampton Roads.  The SSC\\nparticipated at the scene with the planning staff and the OSC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Command Staff.  NOAA\\nprovided information management services including visuals of the trajectory of the spilled\\noil, weather forecasts, on-scene observations of the spilled oil with visuals of these\\nobservations, coordination of the rescue of oiled wildlife, coordination of the shoreline\\nevaluation of the extent of the spilled oil, and interaction with the scientific community.\\n\\nThe SSC coordinated the shoreline assessment that was completed the morning of March 24.\\nThe assessment team included the Commonwealth of Virginia, USCG, NOAA, Shell Oil\\nEnvironmental Division, and Entrix.  The assessment was conducted on land and by small\\nboat.  The southernmost extent of shoreline oiling was on the east bank of the Elizabeth\\nRiver 100 yards south of the Gilmerton Bridge at a location best described as a barge slip.\\nNo oil was found at the booms protecting Milldam and St. Julian creeks or in the creeks\\nthemselves.  The northernmost extent of shoreline oiling was at Hess Oil on the east bank of\\n\\n70\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nthe Elizabeth River.  A band of oil one to two inches wide was found at both the\\nnorthernmost and southernmost extents of shoreline oiling.  The greatest concentration of\\noil was found along one-half mile of shoreline on the west bank of the Elizabeth River south\\nof Atlantic Energy.  Less than one mile of shoreline along the Elizabeth River was affected\\nby oil.\\n\\nNOAA also coordinated preparation of the recommended criteria for shoreline cleanup that\\nwas distributed on March 23.   These criteria included the  manual removal of oil and oily\\ndebris on sandy beaches and noted that the area of affected shoreline was small and\\naccessible during low tide.  The criteria also recommended that oiled material should be\\npicked up using rakes and shovels and placed in plastic bags.  Patches of oil at the high-tide\\nline should be removed.  The criteria noted that the main concern during cleanup operations\\nwould be avoiding physical damage to marsh areas and vegetation.  Removal of live\\nvegetation would not be permitted and cleanup crews would not be permitted to enter\\nmarsh areas.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nVirginia Institute of Marine Science. 1980.

The hazardous materials included two containers filled with 55-pound paper\\ndrums of potassium hydroxide and a third container loaded with small aerosol cans\\nincluding 200 pounds of nitrogen and 2,000 pounds of 1,1,1-trichloroethane.\\n\\nThe Atlantic Strike Team (AST) was requested on-scene and arrived later that evening.  The\\nU.S. Navy responded with tugs, and fire fighting operations began that evening.  An\\noverflight by the AST early the next morning showed fires still burning inside some of the\\ncontainers; fire water from the tugs was not reaching the hot spots.  The containers for these\\nmaterials were not on fire.\\n\\nBehavior of Materials:\\n\\nAll the hazardous materials were located on the bottom tier of containers (resting on the\\nweather deck).  The fire was located in bays 4 and 5, which held primarily refrigerated food\\nstuffs and bales of waste paper or wood.\\n\\n1,1,1-trichloroethane is a common, essentially non-flammable chlorinates solvent, but in a\\nfire  it will produce toxic and irritating chemicals such as phosgene and hydrochloric acid.\\nThere were 2,400 pieces, assumed to be aerosol cans, of solvent intended for use as an\\nelectronic or auto parts degreaser.\\n\\nPotassium hydroxide is a strong, corrosive base that will readily dissolve into water,\\nproducing heat that can ignite combustible materials.\\n\\n79\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe tug Alert maintained a position pointing the bow into the wind in the main harbor area\\nof Hampton Roads.  While the barge was in this holding pattern, the fire burned primarily\\nfrom the fourth bay into the fifth and eventually began to encroach into the sixth bay.\\n\\nThe fire-fighting scene was located in the middle of the harbor, overlapping two different\\nfire department jurisdictions.  Neither the fire departments nor the USCG had vessel fire-\\nfighting capabilities.  Initial fire-fighting efforts by the Navy through the first evening\\nseemed to reduce the fire significantly; however, a pre-dawn overflight on April 16\\nindicated that fire remained within the interior of the cargo bay holding balled waste paper.\\nThis cargo might burn for days unless the contents were individually removed and\\nextinguished one at a time.\\n\\nAt first light on April 16, an assessment-by-vessel conducted by a local hazardous materials\\ncontractor, state emergency response personnel, and the USCG AST showed that the fires\\nwere still burning inside some of the containers and that fire-fighting streams from the Navy\\ntugs were not reaching these hot spots.  Air monitoring around the barge did not indicate\\nany hazardous release of vapors and both the overflight and vessel assessments reported\\nthat the hazardous materials containers did not appear to be involved in the fire.\\n\\nMorning fire-fighting operations were augmented by air drops of sea water from a U.S.\\nArmy National Guard helicopter.  This provided enough water to the center of the\\ncontainers to greatly reduce the fire while the Navy tugs maintained water streams from the\\nsides.  However, further fire fighting would require the use of elevated booms and high-\\nflow pumps that could put high volumes of water into the center of the container stack.\\n\\nIn the evening the barge was brought to Moon Engineering.  The Portsmouth Fire\\nDepartment was able to control the fire and individual containers were removed by crane\\nand taken to remote areas of the terminal where the fires were overhauled one container at a\\ntime.  This operation took several days.  The fire damage to containers and the heavy weight\\nof cargo and containers due to the addition of fire-fighting water slowed the offloading of\\nthe containers.  For example, at 0800 on April 17, the containers that contained burning\\npaper rolls that were stacked on top of the hazardous materials container were too heavy for\\nthe crane because of the added weight of fire-fighting water.  It was necessary to remove the\\ncontents of these containers by hand and clam-shell crane while they remained in place over\\nthe hazardous material containers.\\n\\nFire fighting continued through April 17 and containers were removed and overhauled\\nthrough the night and into April 18 when the container with trichloroethane was removed.\\nThis was the only hazardous materials container that bore any indication of fire damage on\\nthe outside.  The hazardous cargoes were inspected and found to be intact and without\\nobservable fire damage.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nBy noon April 16, before the fire reached the hazardous materials containers, the unified\\ncommand was involved in the analysis of several fire-fighting options.  The capacity to get\\nhigh-flow snorkel fire-fighting equipment in position to fight this fire was considered in the\\nfollowing categories:\\n\\np continue fighting the fire in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstream\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (out in the harbor, transporting heavy\\n\\nequipment on barges or large vessels);\\n\\n80\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\np grounding the vessel and building a ramp for access by heavy equipment;\\n\\np taking the vessel to a container facility and providing access by heavy equipment;\\n\\nand\\n\\np taking the  vessel to a repair facility and providing access by heavy equipment.\\n\\nVessel fires and hazardous materials response on vessels are best done at a safe haven.  First\\npreference for a safe haven is a well-equipped facility (e.g., container facility for container\\nvessels, bulk transfer facility for bulk carriers).  Second preference is to be located at any\\nother available industrial facilities.  The least desirable (for safety of crew and responders, as\\nwell as efficiency of response operations) is open waterways.  On April 16 the owner of the\\nLiberty Trader arranged with Moon Engineering, a vessel repair facility, for the right to bring\\nthe barge alongside so that the local municipal fire fighters could bring appropriate snorkel\\nfire-fighting equipment to the scene.\\n\\nNOAA Activities: \\n\\nNOAA was notified on this incident on April 15, 1994, by MSO Hampton Roads.  The SSC\\nwent on-scene as a member of the Unified Command staff.  The SSC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first task was to\\nparticipate in an assessment of risks of the fire to the hazardous materials listed on the\\ndangerous cargo manifest (DCM).  NOAA provided an on-scene chemist to participate in\\ntechnical discussions while these risk analyses were being conducted.  As the risk\\nassessment was put into perspective when the fire was identified as not impinging on the\\nsame locations as the hazardous materials, other tasks came into consideration.  These tasks\\ninclude information management, analysis of fire-fighting options, analysis of safe haven\\noptions, sampling strategies for hazardous vapors when the fire was in the harbor as well as\\nwhen the barge was permitted to dock at a pier, and planning for the safety of overhaul\\noperations as the containers were taken from the barge.\\n\\nThe SSC also participated as the facilitator during the debrief of the incident on April 22,\\n1994.

The Tokyo Senator was carrying zinc,\\nlead, and arsenic in the starboard and forward sections of Bay 2.  MSO Hampton Roads\\nordered the vessel to wait at the anchorage until an assessment of the danger to the vessel,\\nher crew, or the public could be completed.  The onboard carbon dioxide fire suppression\\nsystem was activated and appeared to limit the spread of the fire.  The Incident Response\\nTeam (IRT), a group of area fire fighters trained to fight fire aboard vessels, determined that\\nthe fire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hot spot was in the after port section of Bay 2, was stable, and the danger to the\\npublic or the crew from those materials on the DCM was minimal.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe Tokyo Senator continued to the pier in the early morning hours of April 29 where the fire\\nwas extinguished by the municipal fire department.  During the first day, the fire damaged\\ncontainer was placed in a remote section of the terminal.  During the second and third days,\\nthe cargo that had spilled into the hold\\xe2\\x80\\x94none of which was a regulated material\\xe2\\x80\\x94was\\ncleaned by IMS, a hazardous waste contractor.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe initial hazard assessment by the IRT placed the fire in the category of a non-hazardous\\nmaterial incident.  On the basis of this assessment, the response activities were treated as if\\nroutine; however, the container most involved by fire contained a urea-based compound\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nthioureadioxide (a non-regulated material used in urea-based fertilizers).  This non-\\nregulated, non-manifested cargo resulted in hazardous gas emissions and smoke inhalation\\nthat caused the hospitalization of 13 firefighters.\\n\\n89\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nNOAA Activities: \\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on April 30, 1994, by MSO Hampton Roads and\\nparticipated at the MSO in incident response planning.  NOAA participated with the MSO\\nstaff in the analysis of risk from the cargoes identified on the DCM.  The incident response\\nstaff was disbanded the morning of April 30 after the IRT determined that the fire was\\nalmost out, the hot spot caused by the fire was not near any cargo listed on the DCM, and\\nthe municipal fire department was capable of any overhaul activities once the vessel was at\\nthe pier.\\n\\nHowever, the report of firefighters being taken to the hospital and subsequent reports from\\nthe contractor after the vessel had sailed suggested that problems had surfaced after the\\nMSO stood down. In the interest of learning from this incident, the MSO Hampton Roads\\nstaff conducted a debrief of the incident on May 6. Critical issues identified were:\\n\\np Hazard assessment activities by all involved parties should have been re-evaluated\\n\\ncontinually.\\n\\np An action plan for the opening of the hatches over Bay 2 should have been\\n\\ndeveloped that allowed for the closure of the  bay if the fire flared up or if some\\nother significant event occurred while the fire scene was exposed to the atmosphere.\\n\\np An action plan should have been developed that allowed for the crane operator to\\n\\nplace the container containing the fire in an appropriate location if the situation\\nbecame unstable during the offloading of the fire-damaged container.  Personnel had\\nnot been removed from the area under the lift of the fire-damaged containers during\\npotential hazardous operations.\\n\\np Action and safety plans should have been developed for the overhaul of the fire-\\n\\ndamaged container at a remote section of the container pier or during cleanup of the\\nvessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hold after the container was removed.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nBudavari, S., M.

When or where the T/B 564 had been damaged and begun to spill JP-5 is unknown.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe JP-5 was seen along the transit path of the T/B 564, with the largest amounts at each\\nplace the barge had paused, such as Great Bridge Lock,   The spill was relatively small and\\nvery little oil was observed.   The sheen dissipated within a few hours, well before the end of\\nthe first day.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nA USCG contractor double-boomed the T/B 564 and boomed across several sensitive areas\\ndescribed in the Area Contingency Plan.  Sorbent pads and booms were deployed to remove\\nthe JP-5 where possible.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe ICWW was closed to commercial and pleasure crafts for about 12 hours.\\n\\nThreatened and endangered species were identified in the immediate vicinity of the spill\\nand included a shrew (Sorex longirostris fisheri), rattlesnake (Crotalus horridus atricaudatus),\\nlizard (Ophisaurus ventralis), tern (Sterna forsteri), and the great egret (Casmerodius albus\\negretta).  NOAA reported that the JP-5 could be acutely toxic to fish, particularly where the\\n\\n95\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\namount of dilution by mixing is limited, especially in confined areas like those of the spill\\nsite.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:   \\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on June 2, 1994, by MSO Hampton Roads and\\nparticipated in the response in the Unified Command at the MSO.  NOAA obtained the\\npotential resources at risk in the unusual pocosin marsh structures in the area.  Subsequent\\nmeetings with the Commonwealth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Conservation and Recreation and the\\nNational Heritage Foundation began the process of including these agencies in the Area\\nContingency Planning structure.\\n\\nNOAA identified the resources at risk as the shoreline of the ICWW canal bordered by tree\\nstumps and snags.  To the south, along the natural river channel, there is a transition to\\nfreshwater marshes.  The water level at the time of the spill was high enough to prevent\\nexposure of the substrate.  NOAA identified JP-5 as a highly volatile type of oil, which also\\ncontains a large amount of acutely toxic compounds.  The JP-5 does not have the smothering\\neffects of the heavier oils on vegetation; rather, it tends to cause acute damage to plant tissue\\nupon contact.  If the oil stayed in contact with shoreline vegetation, particularly freshwater\\ngrasses, for hours to days, the vegetation in direct contact with the slick would likely be\\nkilled.  NOAA predicted that as long as the water level stayed high and the roots were\\nprotected from contact with the oil, the plants would probably survive.\\n\\nFarther to the south, where the freshwater marshes border the river, threatened and\\nendangered plant communities were present.  However, these communities are located\\nwithin the marsh, rather than along the fringe where the oil was most likely to contact the\\nvegetation.  NOAA advised that these communities were not at risk.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nCommonwealth of Virginia, Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, Memorandum\\ndated June 2, 1994.\\n\\nNOAA. 1993.

An estimate of 40 to 50 gallons of oil was initially thought lost.  The vessel was\\nboomed and lightering of suspected tanks (#3 port cargo tank and #4 port ballast tank)\\nbegan.  A diver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inspection reported a 2- by 10-foot breech of the hull in #3 port cargo tank\\nabove the bilge knuckle, and 30 feet of the bilge keel missing.  At 2135 on July 19 it was\\nreported that oil had breached the containment boom and 200 to 300 barrels were in the\\nwater.  It was believed that offloading the cargo in the damaged tank upset the water-\\nbottom, allowing the oil to escape.\\n\\nMobil response team personnel boomed the vessel.  The Delaware Bay and River\\nCooperative (DBRC) launched two skimmers and boomed several pre-identified creeks\\nnearby.  Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) responded with its skimming vessel,\\n\\n105\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nDelaware Responder.  Three additional contractors were hired for the cleanup and a field\\ncommand post was established at the Mobil refinery.\\n\\nThe USCG COTP Philadelphia assumed the FOSC role for this incident. USCG personnel\\nwere on-scene to monitor cleanup activities.  The OSC requested two FLIR overflights (one\\nduring the night of July 19; the other the next morning) to help identify the extent of oil\\nmigration in the river.  The FLIR spotted the oil and helped track its progress.\\n\\nThis response lasted about five days.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe product released was a very light Arabian crude.  It spread on the river\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface into\\nstreamers of dark oil surrounded by large areas of sheen ranging from gray to rainbow.\\nDue to the lightness of the product, there was a great deal of evaporation.\\n\\nThe maximum extent of the slick was approximately 15 miles (10 miles downriver and 5\\nmiles upriver).  Below Little Tinicum Island the oil was mostly on the Pennsylvania/\\nDelaware side of the river; above Little Tinicum Island the oil tended toward the New Jersey\\nside.  Most of the oil remained in the central channel due to very light winds, thereby\\nminimizing shoreline impacts.\\n\\nAn estimated 300 barrels were spilled.  On-water skimming operations recovered about\\n1,000 gallons.  A greater-than-60 percent evaporation (calculated) was expected within the\\nfirst 48 hours.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe vessel was immediately entirely boomed at the facility pier.  Vacuum trucks were used\\nto recover product contained at the site.  The vessel offloaded its cargo to the facility over a\\n30-hour period.\\n\\nPrecautionary protection of sensitive areas was accomplished by DBRC booming pre-\\ndesignated creek mouths with pre-staged boom or boom brought to the site.  This booming\\nstrategy kept the creeks oil-free.\\n\\nOpen-water recovery was performed by three large skimmers and oil was recovered from\\nthe shoreline by several vacuum trucks. Recovered product was sent to the refinery for\\nprocessing.\\n\\nShoreline cleanup was not necessary because the oil evaporated very rapidly and very little\\noil reached shore\\n\\n106\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 5\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe Delaware River was closed to vessel movement between the Walt Whitman and\\nDelaware Memorial bridges for several hours at the onset of the response.  Shortly thereafter\\nthe area was open for movement within the response zone only (moving from one pier to\\nanother).  The waterway was opened to transit through the area after the USCG inspected\\nhulls to ensure no vessels were trailing sheen.  The waterway was completely reopened 10\\nhours later; however, all vessels were required to maintain a no-wake speed so they would\\nnot interfere with response efforts or disrupt booms.\\n\\nNo birds were found oiled nor were there fish kills noted.\\n\\nMedia interest was high at first but dwindled after the third day.\\n\\nThe EPA was conducting an oil-spill bioremediation experiment several miles downriver\\nfrom the affected area.  OIl from the incident did not interfere with the ongoing research.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident at 0500 on July 20, 1994, by MSO Philadelphia who\\nrequested the SSC to report on-scene.  The SSC arrived in Philadelphia at 0700 and was\\nbriefed and trajectories and weather forecasts were discussed.  The Assistant SSC arrived\\non-scene at approximately 1600.  The SSCs participated in two overflights; one at 1000 with\\nthe Delaware State Police, the other at 1500 with the responsible party.  Overflight maps\\nwere created and the evaporation rate of the product was estimated.  The SSCs coordinated\\nfindings and facts with the Damage Assessment Center representative on-scene, and\\nattended morning meetings to discuss cleanup actions.  The SSCs agreed with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno\\ncleanup necessary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d recommendations made by the states and the responsible party.\\n\\nNOAA remained on-scene two days.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.

Berman went aground in the surf zone off Escambron\\nBeach in San Juan, Puerto Rico.  After its towing cable parted, the barge grounded on a hard\\nbottom consisting of rocky substrate with scattered coral.\\n\\nThe barge had a capacity of three million gallons but was reportedly only half full.  The\\ncargo, a heavy #6 fuel oil, began spilling and impacted nearby shoreline and shallow\\nintertidal habitats immediately.  No estimated leakage rate was available.  Due to strong\\nnortherly winds, the surf at the grounding site was quite strong, creating a hazardous\\nsituation as waves pounded the deck of the vessel.\\n\\nThe responsible party initially assumed responsibility for the spill, but very quickly\\nexpended the ten-million dollar limit of their insurance policy.  Full Federal funding of the\\nspill occurred at 0600 on January 14 and it became a USCG-directed response.\\n\\nThe USCG Gulf Strike Team (GST) was brought on-scene and immediately began lightering\\noperations for the barge.  Skimming and lightering operations were effective and removed an\\nestimated 17,700 barrels of oil from the water and leaking barge.  Shoreline cleanup and\\n\\n133\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\nassessment began almost immediately.  Little progress was made, however, due to\\ncontinued leaking of fresh oil from the barge.  Cleaned areas became re-oiled and areas not\\nyet cleaned became more heavily impacted.  Protection strategies were employed for areas\\nat risk that were not yet oiled.  Intensive shoreline cleanup was postponed for the most\\nheavily impacted areas until the sources of re-oiling could be stopped.  Two shallow lagoons\\nnear the grounding site were most heavily impacted.  Oil, in the form of large mats,\\naccumulated on the surface and on the bottom of the lagoons.  This submerged oil posed a\\nmajor cleanup problem during the response.  It was eventually partially removed by divers,\\nvacuum transfer units, and a dredge.  Waste and oily water from dredging operations were\\ncollected and separated in a series of swimming pools arranged to decant and filter the\\neffluent from the dredge before returning the filtered water to the sea.\\n\\nOn January 15, the barge was refloated, towed to a scuttling site 20 miles northeast of San\\nJuan, and sunk.  This operation was carefully reviewed by the FOSC, NAVSUPSALV, the\\nGST, and NOAA.  The RRT was consulted and on-scene trustee representatives were given\\nan opportunity to discuss the operation and voice their concerns.  These groups reached a\\nconsensus that sinking the barge was the best alternative because continued re-oiling of the\\nnearshore environment from the unrecoverable oil left onboard was delaying cleanup and\\npreventing resource recovery.  Resource concerns offshore were minimal and it was believed\\nthat the amount of residual oil left on the barge when it sank would be small and have little\\nimpact.  Shorelines at risk from any oil released during the scuttling operations were\\npredicted to be on northwestern Puerto Rico, Mona Island, and Hispaniola.\\n\\nShoreline cleaning continued in earnest and was more successful with the barge removed.\\nSurface and buried oil along sand beaches was removed following cleanup guidelines.\\nBeachrock, riprap, and seawalls were cleaned with pressure washing and chemical cleaners\\nas approved.  Some areas were left to clean themselves naturally due to inaccessability, low\\nlevels of human use, or high wave energy.  Cleanup guidelines for oiled historical structures\\nwere developed and approved by trustees through the Heritage Resource Team.  These\\nstructures and resources were then cleaned according to those guidelines.\\n\\nOn February 3, oil impacts along northwestern Puerto Rico were reported.  A convergence\\nzone at the northwest corner of the island concentrated debris and oil still being released\\nfrom the scuttled barge.  Impacts were primarily along 12 miles of shoreline, from Isabella to\\nBorinquen.  This oil was buried as oily sand layers and submerged as oil and sand mats in\\nthe protected areas or crenulate bays.  A separate command post was established on the\\nwest end of the island and assessments and cleanup operations began immediately.  Crews\\nremoved the stranded oil quickly to prevent additional burial.  Cleanup efforts were\\nintensified in this area to minimize risks to nesting sea turtles, whose arrival was imminent.\\n\\nAll necessary cleanup guidelines and inspection criteria were in place by mid-February.\\nWith the exception of nearshore reef fish and benthic organisms near the barge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s grounding\\nsite, there were very few visible impacts to biological resources.   Seagrasses were oiled near\\nthe grounding site.  Very few birds were grossly oiled and no substantiated reports of spill\\nrelated mortalities to reptiles or mammals were received.  The impacted shoreline was\\ndivided into 18 shoreline segments or zones.  Most of these zones were cleaned and\\ninspected following the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow clean is clean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guidelines, and approved by the FOSC by\\nApril 4.  All other zones were signed off by April 25, with the exception of zone 18, which\\nwas completed on May 27.  Once approved as clean, each zone entered a monitoring and\\nmaintenance phase to address any additional oiling that might occur.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\n134\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\nThis oil was a highly viscous #6 fuel oil in the Group 5 range with an American Petroleum\\nInstitute (API) gravity of 9.5.  The specific gravity of this oil when spilled was lower than\\nthe surrounding waters so it floated.  The majority of the spilled oil  created a slick that\\nmoved predictably to the west with the longshore currents.  Prevailing winds tended to push\\nthe oil shoreward, heavily impacting the shallow lagoons and beaches near the grounding\\nsite.  Subsequent tides refloated some of the beached oil and it continued to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbounce\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwestward in the form of sheens and tarballs.\\n\\nThe oil offshore was tracked by a USCG side-looking airborne radar (SLAR)-equipped\\naircraft that worked closely and coordinated with NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on-scene personnel.  SLAR\\nimagery was used with visual overflight data to better assess movement and concentration\\nof the oil.\\n\\nThis oil had a high concentration of heavy aromatics and was acutely toxic to large numbers\\nof territorial reef fish and benthic organisms near the grounding site.  This was evident in the\\nfish kills and high numbers of mollusk and echinoderm mortalities that occurred in the early\\ndays of the spill.\\n\\nBeached oil tended to coat surfaces and then harden as it weathered.  Oil burial occurred in\\nsome sand beach areas when work crews could not remove the oil before subsequent high\\ntides.\\n\\nSeveral factors are worth noting that may provide some insight as to why this oil\\naccumulated as submerged tarmats, patches, clumps, or tarballs in shallow nearshore areas.\\nThe barge had been loaded shortly before sailing at a nearby refinery.  The heavy residual\\nGroup 5 was mixed with another product(s) as it was loaded onto the barge.  Reports\\nindicate that this oil was initially so viscous that it would not flow until heated to 120\\xc2\\xb0F, so\\nit was loaded at a temperature of 180\\xc2\\xb0F.  If the raw residual oil and the cutterstock were\\nincompatible they may have separated when discharged.  If the raw residual had a specific\\ngravity equal to or greater than the surrounding water, the possibility would exist for part of\\nthe spilled product to sink, particularly in nearshore areas where it might pick up sand.\\nExamination of separate samples of the raw residual oil and the cutterstock used for\\nblending may have offered information on the compatibility of the mixture, its likelihood to\\nseparate into individual fractions as it cooled and entered the water, and potential for\\nsinking or becoming neutrally buoyant.\\n\\nThat this oil was spilled nearshore in a high energy surf zone is an important factor.  This oil\\nwas well mixed throughout the water column due to wave action.  This mixing caused the oil\\nto pick up sand and become heavier.  Calculations show that as little as two percent sand\\nby weight could have been enough to cause this oil to sink.  Whether the oil manifested itself\\nin large mats, patches, clumps, or tarballs is most likely related to the physical forces, wave\\ntype, wave intensity, and duration of exposure that it was subjected to.\\n\\nRefloating of some of the submerged oil was observed daily.  The oil would tend to rise from\\nthe bottom in small globules (like a lava lamp), break free, surface, and create a sheen.  This\\nphenomenon was most noticeable during the afternoons in shallow lagoons.  There are three\\ntheories to explain the mechanism by which this occurred:\\n\\np Downward sand migration through the oil that allowed portions of the submerged\\n\\noil to become lighter and refloat is one idea.  This theory was tested and observed in\\na jar containing seawater and the source oil mixed with sand.  The oil/sand mixture\\nwould, over time, separate and allow the oil to refloat.\\n\\n135\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\np Another mechanism whereby submerged oil might refloat is related to solar heating.\\n\\nThis theory would support observations in the shallow lagoons where oil would\\nrefloat more frequently during the afternoon with increased sun angle and higher\\ntemperatures.  This mechanism would probably be applicable only in shallow-water\\nareas where a slight temperature differential would be effective.\\n\\np Another theory is related to increased water column mixing, i.e., turbulence.  This\\neffect could occur due to wave-induced currents related to sea breeze effects and\\nwould be more pronounced in the afternoon.\\n\\nA combination of all three may be valid for specific conditions.\\n\\nDuring the barge scuttling operation there was an anticipated and predicted discharge of oil.\\nA large initial release occurred at the grounding site as the barge was refloated.  This\\ndischarge impacted the previously hit areas near the grounding site.  As the barge was\\ntowed to the predetermined scuttle site, it left a sheen trail that impacted some new areas\\nfarther east.  This was because the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s track was immediately in a northeast direction.\\nFollowing the sinking of the barge, an estimated 200 barrels of oil was observed on the\\nsurface at the scuttling site.  This oil slick moved predictably westward and began to break\\nup into tarballs and patches.  A near-constant sheen continued to be observed at the scuttle\\nsite over the next several months.  This was consistently a thin silver sheen extending one-\\nquarter to one-half mile to the west.  It is thought that this sheen resulted from a small\\nconstant leak of residual oil and oil left clinging to the barge.\\n\\nWithin two weeks of the barge scuttling, shoreline impacts were reported on the northwest\\nend of Puerto Rico.  This impact zone had been pinpointed in a trajectory forecast made\\nbefore the vessel was scuttled.  Two new impact zones were designated covering the\\nshoreline from Punta Cerro Gordo to Surfers Beach south of Punta Borinquen.  Submerged\\noil mats were discovered in several protected areas and crenulate bays along the northwest\\ncoast.  This oil was more emulsified than the submerged oil near San Juan.  It is thought that\\nthis oil floated from the scuttle site, converged in these protected areas, and mixed with\\nenough sand to cause it to sink.  Cleanup crews were able to remove most of the submerged\\noil using vacuum/suction devices and submersible dredges.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nEarly in the response, the Area Contingency Plan was consulted for guidance on resource\\nprotection priorities and protection strategies.  Various sites where sensitive shoreline or\\nother resources were at risk were visited and ground-truthed for appropriate condition-\\nspecific protection strategies.  Several protection strategies were added or altered from the\\narea plan to fit the specific conditions existing at the time of the spill.  These strategies were\\nthen implemented where needed prior to oil impacts, thereby preventing oiling of the more\\ncritical and sensitive areas.\\n\\nThe grounded barge was not boomed because of the intensity of the surf.  Crews worked in\\nextremely hazardous conditions to lighter oil from the Morris J. Berman to another barge.  As\\ntime progressed, the oil became more viscous and difficult to pump making lightering\\nineffective.  However, lightering efforts continued until the barge was prepared for towing to\\nthe scuttle site.\\n\\nScuttling of the barge was chosen as a response countermeasure and mitigation action.  As\\nthe barge continued to leak oil at the grounding site, shoreline cleanup and recovery\\nprocesses were showing little progress.  Shorelines and other natural and socioeconomic\\nresources in the area continued to be re-oiled by these recurring discharges.  The sensitivity\\n\\n136\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\nof these areas was heightened because this oiling was affecting one of Puerto Rico\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prime\\ntourist locations.  It was felt that once the source of oil was removed,  shoreline cleanup and\\nresource recovery would progress rapidly\\n\\nA naval munitions dump site located approximately 20 miles northeast of San Juan, with a\\nwater depth of 6,000 feet, was selected as the scuttle site.  An option to tow the barge\\nfarther into even deeper water was reviewed, but appeared to offer no additional benefit.\\nRather, it was felt that other islands to the west of Puerto Rico would be at greater risk for\\ntarball impacts the farther away from Puerto Rico the barge was towed.  Options\\nconsidered before the barge was disposed of were: use of dispersants on the residual oil, use\\nof solidifiers, and offshore detonation of the vessel.  After review, testing, and consultation,\\nthese options offered no benefit.  Although some new areas were oiled as a result of the\\nscuttle operation, impacts in these areas had been predicted and preparations had been\\nmade to protect resources and conduct cleanup operations quickly.\\n\\nFloating oil was collected effectively inshore where skimming systems were being used.\\nOffshore oil was collected by the MSRC vessel Caribbean Responder.  Due primarily to sea\\nconditions, collection of offshore oil met with limited success.  Nighttime skimming was\\nattempted by a FLIR-equipped helicopter giving directions, but this proved unsuccessful.\\n\\nManual cleanup methods were used on accessible shorelines.  Shovels, rakes, and sifting\\nscreens were used to remove oil from the sand; conveyor-driven separators were used in\\nsome areas.  Sand, rocks, and gravel were washed with a chemical treatment then replaced,\\nland farmed, or disposed of.  Some mechanical cleanup was conducted with tillers and\\nsmall bulldozers.  Care was always taken to conduct cleanup operations in a manner that\\nwould cause the least additional impact to the resources.  In several areas, trees were\\nwrapped with visqueen as a protective measure.  Of special concern were turtle nesting\\nareas, beach dunes, and identified pre-Columbian archaeological sites.  Initial guidelines\\nrequired that no heavy equipment or vehicles operate in areas of archaeological sites.  It was\\nfelt that most of the oiled shoreline was in active transport zones where sand was cyclically\\neroded or deposited by tides and storms and that any unearthing of artifacts would be\\nunlikely.  Equipment-use guidelines were therefore modified.\\n\\nChemical shoreline cleaners, along with hot-water, high-pressure washing, were evaluated\\nfor use on shorelines that were designated as \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh-public use\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and for which quick and\\nmore thorough cleaning was desired, and for low-energy areas where natural and mechanical\\ncleaning would not be sufficient to prevent the formation of hardened tarmats or pavement.\\nAfter testing and evaluating, the Caribbean Regional Response Team (CRRT) approved\\nlimited use of Corexit 9580 with a two-tiered monitoring plan.  Prior to initial chemical use,\\na monitoring plan was implemented whereby bivalves, sea urchins, and snails were\\ntransplanted to the treatment area and left to be exposed to whatever impacts might result\\nfrom the approved chemical treatment.  They were then observed and compared to controls\\nfor signs of negative effects.  The second aspect of this monitoring plan consisted of simple\\nobservations and monitoring for gross adverse effects, such as high organism mortality\\nduring all subsequent use of the cleaner.  Pertinent information was recorded for all\\napplications.  If adverse effects were observed, operations were to be re-evaluated by the\\nFOSC with guidance from the NOAA SSC and trustees.  The selection of Corexit 9580 was\\nbased on effectiveness, toxicity data, and observed results during testing.\\n\\nMany oil spill response agent vendors arrived on-site in attempts to demonstrate their\\nproduct, or sent materials to the command post.  NOAA helped the FOSC categorize and\\nevaluate products for potential use should a specific cleanup need arise that called for their\\nuse.\\n\\n137\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\nThe oiling of several historical resources and the potential for further damage from cleanup\\nefforts led to the formation of the Heritage Resource Team.  This team, with representation\\nfrom Federal and commonwealth trustees, the USCG, and NOAA, worked together to\\nevaluate and make recommendations to the FOSC for all response actions that might further\\nimpact historical structures, archaeological sites, or cultural resources.\\n\\nExacting measures were implemented to clean and protect oiled historical sites, including\\nFort San Geronimo, several historic walls, the Tajamar Ruins, and the Escambron Battery.\\nAs a protective measure, walls, subject to damage from responders, were wrapped and\\ntaped.  The Heritage Resource Team, consisting of representatives from the Institute of\\nPuerto Rican Culture; the State Historic Preservation Office; the Department of the Interior\\n(DOI), National Park Service; the FOSC; and NOAA, carefully evaluated cleanup methods\\nranging from dabbing or wiping masonry with oil-absorbent snares to high-pressure, hot-\\nwater washing and chemical treatments.  The least intrusive and adequately effective\\nmethod of cleaning was agreed upon and then implemented under close supervision and\\nmonitoring.\\n\\nRecovery of submerged oil proved to be difficult and costly.  An innovative decanting and\\nfiltering system using a series of three full-size swimming pools was used to separate oil,\\nwater, and sediment obtained from dredging operations in the two shallow lagoons near the\\ngrounding site.  Diver-directed vacuum techniques and manual removal were conducted in\\nother areas.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nChemical shoreline cleaning agents were reviewed, selected, and tested.  The CRRT granted\\napproval for limited use of Corexit 9580 in areas where natural or non-chemical cleaning\\nmethods where judged to be ineffective or too slow.  The basis for selection of Corexit 9580\\nwas related to its effectiveness and low toxicity.\\n\\nOne of the issues of special interest was the occurrence of other \"mystery spills\" impacting\\nshorelines of St. Thomas, St. Johns, St. Croix, Culebra, Vieques, and the east and northeast\\ncoasts of Puerto Rico.  Reports of these impacts began on January 21 and continued\\nsporadically for about a month.  Laboratory analyses showed that these impacts were not\\noil from the Morris J. Berman; nonetheless, assessments and cleanup operations had to be\\naddressed for these areas.  Local resources were used when available.  Additional work\\ncrews were sent from San Juan to assist.  It is assumed that these oilings occurred as a result\\nof multiple illegal bilge washings or unreported oil discharges.\\n\\nResources at risk included shoreline habitat, the majority of which were sand or mixed sand\\nand gravel beaches, and some rocky points and headlands.  Additionally, some wetlands,\\nmangroves, and small inlets had potential for impacts.\\n\\nBiological resources at risk included several species of diving birds, gulls and terns, wading\\nbirds, shorebirds, raptors, and waterfowl.  Of special concern were endangered or\\nthreatened species, including royal terns, common terns, roseate terns, least terns, brown\\npelicans, magnificent frigate birds, Caribbean coots, Bahamas ducks, osprey, and peregrine\\nfalcons.\\n\\nNumerous species of fish and shellfish were at risk, primarily in the areas of heaviest oil\\nconcentration.\\n\\nThe endangered West Indian manatee, common throughout the spill area, was at risk from\\ningesting either floating oil or oiled vegetation.\\n\\n138\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\nThe hawksbill, green, and leatherback sea turtles are common to the spill area and were at\\nrisk from ingesting floating oil.  Additionally, oiled turtle nesting beaches were of concern\\ndue to the toxic or thermal effects of oiled sand on the sensitive turtle eggs and hatchlings.\\n\\nSocioeconomic resources at risk included major tourist beaches and hotels with associated\\nactivities such as boating, jet-skiing, casino gambling, shopping and sight seeing, commercial\\nand recreational fishing, docks and marinas including the port facilities used extensively by\\nthe cruise ship industry.   Numerous archaeological, historical, and cultural resources along\\nthe coast were at risk from oiling and cleanup efforts.  Also, a major power plant intake\\nlocated west of Balo Secoin was in the risk area.\\n\\nFish tainting was another issue addressed.  Although there was never any evidence or\\nreports of fish tainting, local fishermen claimed that their fish were not selling due to public\\nconcern that the fish might be tainted.  Meetings were held to discuss this issue with the\\nCommonwealth Department of Health, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the\\nDepartment of Agriculture, Sea Grant, NOAA, and the USCG.  It was debated whether\\nprecise laboratory analysis of fish tissue and bile was necessary, or whether simple\\norganoleptic methods of inspection would suffice to determine an actual tainting problem.\\nAlso, the problem of how to report the findings to the public was discussed.

At 0530 MSO personnel on-scene reported a small amount of fuel\\nleaking from the vessel.  Observers on an 0845 overflight reported that the vessel was\\naground and a light sheen extended approximately one-half mile west of the grounding site.\\n\\nAn attempt to pull the vessel from the reef at 1300 was unsuccessful.  It was thought that\\nthe ship\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hull might be penetrated by a coral pinnacle.  By late afternoon the FOSC,\\nresponsible party, contractors, and resource trustees from the marine sanctuary and the\\nState of Florida convened at the command post and began planning salvage and response\\noperations.  Due to the uncertain condition of the vessel, it was decided to delay any\\nattempts to refloat the ship until the following day, when response equipment would be on-\\nscene.  The vessel was boomed, anchored, and ballasted to remain firmly aground overnight.\\nShe was tended by a tug contracted by the responsible party and NOAA marine sanctuary\\nboats.  Contingencies for  anchoring in a preferred location away from sensitive resources\\nwere developed in case of inadvertent refloating during the night.  Fuel from damaged tanks\\nwas transferred into intact tanks to prevent any additional leakage.\\n\\nBy late morning on August 12, all response equipment was on-scene, with responders\\npreparing to attempt refloating during the afternoon high tide.  The vessel was successfully\\nrefloated at 1230, inspected by salvors and divers, and released by the FOSC to transit\\nunder power to Key West for temporary repairs.  No further fuel leaks were observed during\\nthe refloating or inspections.  The vessel was escorted by a tug and three vessels carrying\\npollution response equipment and completed the transit uneventfully at approximately\\n2100 that evening.  No resource impacts were reported as a result of marine pollution from\\n\\n140\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\nthis incident.  Assessments of the physically impacted coral reef from the grounding are\\nongoing.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nThe sheens observed early in this incident behaved predictably, moving with currents and\\nprevailing winds to the west and dissipating within about one-half mile of the source.  It is\\nestimated that no more than 200 gallons of oil were lost.   It is suspected that most of the\\nsheen was a result of pumping compartments that had been flooded with seawater and\\nsome residual fuel.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nNo pollution impacts were reported from this incident.  Protective measures included\\nbooming the vessel and pre-staging response equipment if there were further discharges\\nduring the refloating operations.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThis incident occurred within the boundaries of the Florida Keys National Marine\\nSanctuary, one of the most critically sensitive environments in Florida.  Media interest was\\nhigh during the incident.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on August 11, 1994, and asked to provide a worst-case\\ntrajectory and a resources-at-risk report.   The SSC was asked to report to the command\\npost established in Marathon, Florida.\\n\\nThe SSC indicated that the primary concerns were the potential for:\\n\\np physical damage to the reef structure as the result of grounding and subsequent\\n\\nsalvage operations; and\\n\\np a larger spill or loss of the vessel on the shallow reef depending on the structural\\n\\nintegrity and seaworthiness of the ship.\\n\\nThe SSC provided a trajectory analysis, resource at risk report, tides and weather\\ninformation, and helped develop appropriate protection and contingency strategies. The\\nSSC provided the FOSC with on-scene scientific support for the duration of the response.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA Hotline #161, 9 Reports\\n\\nUSCG POLREPS for  FPN incident 07-4074, NOAA\\n\\n141\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\n142\\n\\n\\x0cName of Spill: \\nNOAA SSC: \\nUSCG District:\\nDate of Spill: \\nLocation of Spill: \\nLatitude: \\nLongitude: \\nSpilled Material: \\nSpilled Material Type: \\nAmount: \\nSource of Spill: \\nResources at Risk: \\n\\nDispersants: \\nBioremediation: \\nIn-situ Burning: \\nOther Special Interest: \\n\\nIncident Summary:\\n\\nUSCG District 7\\n\\nLittle Wendy D\\nBradford Benggio\\n7\\n3/9/94\\nBush Key, Dry Tortugas National Park, Florida\\n24\\xc2\\xb037.5\\xe2\\x80\\x99 N\\n082\\xc2\\xb052.0\\xe2\\x80\\x99 W\\ndiesel fuel\\n2\\n1,404 gallons\\nnon-tank vessel\\nBirds: brown pelicans, sooty terns, brown noddys\\nHabitat: seagrass beds, coarse-grained sand beaches\\nmangroves, exposed seawalls, seagrass beds\\nShellfish:  shrimp, lobster, stone crab, conch\\nFish: territorial reef species\\nN\\nN\\nN\\nsalvage options\\n\\nDuring adverse weather on March 3, 1994, the 60-foot wooden shrimping boat, Little Wendy\\nD, was intentionally grounded in the Dry Tortugas National Park on a sand bottom in six\\nfeet of water.  The National Park Service deployed sorbent boom around the vessel.\\n\\nIt at first appeared that the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner was going to make repairs and move his vessel;\\nhowever, on March 9 the Park Service reported that the owner had stripped the vessel of\\nvaluables and electronic equipment and abandoned it.\\n\\nOn March 11 1,404 gallons of diesel fuel were offloaded from the vessel leaving only light\\nresidue in bilge spaces.  The fuel tanks were completely emptied and filled with seawater.\\nAll sheen was contained and recovered by the sorbent boom.  On March 12 the FOSC\\nrepresentatives departed.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nBy March 15 it appeared that proper precautions had been taken concerning booming.  The\\nonly remaining pollution threat was the residual fuel in the bilge, residual fuel in lines and\\nhoses (estimated to be no more than two gallons), some lubricating oil on deck machinery,\\ntwo propane tanks, some containers of roofing cement, and general loose debris on deck and\\nin the cabin.  The ADIOS model indicated little threat to the resources at hand.\\n\\n143\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 7\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nSeveral teleconference calls were held with the USCG and DOI trustees to discuss salvage\\noptions for the vessel.  The USCG agreed to totally remove any pollution threat but advised\\nDOI that they could not, under the authority of the National Contingency Plan (NCP), use\\nthe Oil Pollution Fund to conduct salvage operations for a vessel that presented no\\npollution threat.\\n\\nA salvage vessel from Ft. Lauderdale was expected on March 15, but was delayed en route.\\nThe NOAA SSC drafted a site safety plan that was approved by the FOSC representative\\nand used by on-scene response personnel until the salvage vessel arrived.\\n\\nThe salvage vessel arrived on the night of March 16 and began operations the next morning.\\nAll loose items were removed from the vessel and additional boom was deployed.\\nMachinery on deck was removed and the engine and surrounding bulkheads and deck were\\npressure-washed to remove any oil or oily residue.  Some minor sheen was present during\\nthe cleaning and was contained and collected in the sorbent boom.  The vessel was\\ndetermined totally cleaned and free from oil pollution threat on March 19 and certified by\\non-scene DOI representatives.  The vessel was left for final salvage disposition to be\\nconducted by DOI.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on March 9, 1994, by the USCG.  On March 15, the SSC\\nand representatives of the FOSC went on-scene to assess the situation and remove any\\npollution threat from the vessel.  They surveyed the vessel, noting hull damage on the bow\\nwhere planking was separating.  Concerns for the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s structural integrity and its\\nstability were expressed because a port list was increasing noticeably.\\n\\nNOAA met with a bird expert from the National Everglades Park on-scene to discuss\\nprotection strategies and other special concerns for the nesting birds nearby.  This expert\\ntold the SSC that, because the birds of concern do not feed or bathe in the waters next to the\\ngrounded vessel, and due to the amount of fuel remaining onboard was small, there was no\\nneed to be concerned for the birds\\xe2\\x80\\x99 safety.  The NOAA SSC mapped the area where these\\nbirds were congregating and presented additional booming protection strategies to the FOSC\\nrepresentative.\\n\\n References:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.

Investigation led\\nto the discovery of a transfer pipeline failure and EDC on the ground and under a layer of\\nwater in an adjacent ditch.  The ditch outflow to the Calcasieu River was blocked and\\nrecovery operations began.  By May 31, approximately 630,000 pounds (1,500 barrels) of\\nEDC had been recovered from the ditch.  Conoco\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contractor collected a sediment sample\\nfrom the Calcasieu River.  Analysis of this sample revealed a concentration of 11,800 parts\\nper million of EDC prompting a new sampling plan for the river.  On June 7, the U.S. EPA\\nassumed the role of FOSC, a representative from the state was designated OSC, and\\nNOAA and the GST were released from the scene.  When NOAA left the scene, a river\\nsampling program was underway using core sampling in deep areas and grab samples in\\nshallower areas to collect sediments on the river bottom and determine the extent of\\ncontamination.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nEDC is heavier then water and has a low solubility.  It was unclear if the EDC had filtered\\nthrough sediment into the groundwater. Additional tests will be performed to cover the\\nextent of the spill on land and to determine the source of the contamination seen in the river.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe USCG became involved when the contamination was seen in the river on May 31.\\nBefore then the responsible party had filled approximately 300, twenty-cubic yard\\ncontainers of contaminated soil from the ditch.  The responsible party had also pumped the\\ncontaminated liquid from the ditch to an on-site holding tank.  Freshwater influx was\\ndiverted around the ditch by using high-powered pumps and PVC piping.\\n\\nOther Special Interests:\\n\\nIt is unclear if this spill was an acute or chronic problem.  The EDC is transferred to Vista\\nLaboratory and sent straight into production.  Vista Laboratory said no mass balances\\n\\n149\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 8\\n\\ncould be done to see the extent of the spill.  From the sampling done in the river it was\\nfound to be a localized problem.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on June 3, 1994.  The SSC was on-scene June 3 though\\n10.  NOAA prepared a report describing the physical and chemical properties of EDC; its\\nreactions with air, fresh water, and salt water; the environmental consequences of an EDC\\nspill in a shallow coastal marine setting at low- and mid-latitude locations; the\\nenvironmental consequences of an EDC spill in a deep offshore marine setting in a low- or\\nmid-latitude area; the ultimate fate of EDC in mid- and low-latitude marine environments;\\nand an EDC spill recovery plan to include post-spill monitoring.  The report was distributed\\non-scene.  NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s team on-scene also helped the RP develop a river sampling plan to\\ndetermine the extent of contamination in the river.\\n\\nThe SSC worked with the Water Quality, Ground Water, and Hazardous Materials\\ndivisions of Louisiana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department of Environmental Quality.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nChapman, P.M., G.

The failure occurred below the ground near a pipe junction on the east side\\nof Harbor Boulevard just south of Ventura, California.  Approximately 2,000 barrels of a\\nheavy crude produced from a local field percolated through the ground to the west and\\nunderneath the road.  The oil surfaced 50 yards west of Harbor Boulevard and entered a\\ncreek,  traveled along this creek approximately 150 yards to the south where it entered\\nMcGrath Lake.\\n\\nMcGrath is a freshwater lake (approximately 800 by 100 yards) situated among medium-\\ncoarse grained sand dunes and located 100 to 200 yards inshore of the intertidal zone.  The\\nlake serves as a drainage basin for the surrounding agricultural fields and has no natural\\ncommunication with the ocean.  To control the lake level, water is routinely pumped out of\\nthe lake and into the Pacific Ocean through a pipeline running through the dunes and onto\\nthe beach.  When the oil entered the lake, the pump was on and oil was discharged onto the\\nsand beach and into the nearshore environment.  Less than 100 barrels of oil entered the\\nocean; the majority was contained in the lake, the creek, or was saturated in the sediment.\\n\\nThe mouth of the Santa Clara River was bermed to prevent oil from entering the estuary.  To\\ncontrol the amount of water flowing through the spill site, water was diverted from the\\ncreek to the Santa Clara River via pumps.  Underflow dams and filter fences with sorbent\\npompoms were installed along the creek.  The vegetated shoreline of the creek and the lake,\\nconsisting mostly of tules, was heavily coated with oil.  Because all pumping operations had\\nceased, the water level in the lake was rising and began covering over already-impacted\\n\\n157\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nshoreline, affecting more habitat as it rose.  After consulting with the Regional Water\\nQuality Control Board (RWQCB), pumping the lake into the ocean began again and the\\nwater level was lowered to where it had been before the spill.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nFor the first two days of the spill, oil entered the ocean as mostly sheen and scattered\\npatches of oil.  Offshore recovery operations were limited to a few days of attempted\\nrecovery of sheens and tarballs.\\n\\nApproximately 12 miles of beach (from Ventura to Ormond Beach) were impacted with\\nscattered tarballs that were transported by the long shore currents to the south, except for\\nthe first few days of the spill when there appeared to be a northerly current.  The tarballs\\nranged from one to four centimeters in diameter and were most often associated with high-\\ntide swashes.  The tarballs often had thin protrusions, or legs, once they were stranded on\\nthe beach.  These formations were given the colloquial title of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspiders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Cleanup crews\\nwere dispatched to nine designated beach segments to remove the tarballs.  Most of the\\ncrews were given lawn rollers covered with plastic sheeting.  This method proved effective\\nin picking up cohesive tarballs associated with high-tide swashes.  Shoreline cleanup crews\\nspent three weeks cleaning tarballs from the sand beaches.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nOiled vegetation along the shore of the lake was removed manually by crews working in\\nsmall work skiffs.  Oil entered a creek densely populated with tules.  The tules were cut\\nabove the root structure and removed by a unique piece of machinery known as the\\nAQUAMOG.  This equipment was specifically designed to cut and remove vegetation in\\nshallow-water areas.  The AQUAMOG is equipped with wheels that can be moved to the\\nside allowing it to float.  It was brought on-scene to cut and remove vegetation in the dense-\\ngrowth areas of the creek where access by boats and work crews was difficult.\\n\\nThe free-floating oil in McGrath Lake was boomed and gathered for skimming.  The\\nmovement of the oil on the lake was controlled by the direction of the wind and moved\\nthroughout the containment area during the day.\\n\\nThe local harbors were boomed initially after the oil was released into the ocean but were\\nopened as the threat of oiling became less likely.  The mouth of the Santa Clara River\\nremained bermed for two weeks, but was then opened to allow the estuary to drain.  Water\\nhad been accumulating and causing the estuary to swell beyond its normal size and was\\nimpacting the campgrounds at an adjacent state park.\\n\\n158\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe beaches impacted by the oil were closed to allow work crews to operate.  These beaches\\nare used by the local communities for general recreation and were reopened once the\\nsegments were deemed clean.\\n\\nApproximately 140 assorted shorebirds and waterfowl were killed as a result of the spill;\\nabout 50 were rehabilitated and released.  Wildlife collection, rehabilitation, and release\\nwere conducted by the California Department of Fish and Game (CF&G), USFWS, and\\nInternational Bird Rescue Research Center.  Propane cannons were used throughout the\\nresponse (mainly at night) to haze birds attempting to land on McGrath Lake to protect\\nthem from further impacts .\\n\\nThis section of coastline is nesting habitat for the snowy plover (endangered) during the\\nspring and summer months.  Representatives from the USFWS conducted surveys to ensure\\nnone had begun to nest early.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified on December 26, 1993, by the USCG MSD in Santa Barbara, California\\nwho requested the SSC to report on-scene.\\n\\nThe SSC arrived on-scene December 27 and participated daily in formulating the Action\\nPlan, helped USFWS representatives voice their concerns to the FOSC, and contacted the\\nNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to discuss habitat issues pertinent to the spill\\n(there were no impacts to marine mammals).\\n\\nNOAA provided tidal information and situation update maps showing the nine beach\\nsegments and their status and produced a base map of McGrath Lake that was used by\\nresponders to develop strategies and disseminate information.\\n\\nThroughout the response, NOAA provided daily weather forecasts and long-range forecasts\\nto the FOSC.

Approximately 3,500 barrels of San Joaquin Valley Crude\\nexited the pipeline and traveled through a culvert to a drainage ditch and then into the\\nSanta Clara River.  The oil traveled downstream (west) roughly 15 miles to a point where\\nthe river runs underground.  The impact site was located 35 miles inland of the Pacific\\nOcean  in the U.S.  EPA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s zone.\\n\\nThe river vegetation was heavily impacted by the oil and large quantities of oil were\\nentrapped in the expansive watercress beds.  Cleanup crews were dispatched to cut\\nthousands of square yards of vegetation to free up this oil.  The freed oil, along with the cut\\nvegetation, floated downstream to collection points.  So much vegetation was cut that it\\noverwhelmed the collection points and floated downstream to the terminus.  At the river\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nterminus, two huge underflow dams were constructed using heavy machinery to protect\\nagainst an increase in river flow should the area experience a significant amount of rainfall.\\n\\nQuestions were raised by the FOSC about the integrity of the dams that controlled the water\\nflow and two sewage treatment plants that discharged their effluent into the Santa Clara\\nRiver.  The SSC contacted the emergency office of the Federal Emergency Management\\nAgency (FEMA) that had been set up in response to the earthquake.  FEMA was able to\\nconfirm that all the dams were sound and that they were still in the \"catchment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mode and\\nwould not be discharging water into the river.  The sewage treatment plants were\\napparently operating in good order and were not discharging any hazardous effluent into\\nthe river.\\n\\nThe weather during the initial phases of the response was mostly fair and mild.  However,\\nwith cleanup crews working on mud roads in the river valley, long-range forecasts were\\n\\n161\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\ncrucial for planning purposes.  (In 1991 a similar spill occurred in this same location under\\nvery much the same conditions and a three-inch rainfall flooded the river, wiped out several\\ncontainment berms, and ended operations.)  On January 25 work was halted due to a half-\\ninch of rain that fell in the area.  The first dam at the terminus was breached in three places\\nbut heavy machinery was brought in to shore it up.  Unpaved roads in the river valley\\nbecame impassable because of the mud.\\n\\nThe main wildlife concern of the USFWS was the potential destruction of habitat for the\\nendangered unarmored threespine stickleback.  Survey teams from California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Department\\nof Fish and Game and the USFWS designated stickleback-population areas along the river\\nthat were to be avoided during cleanup operations.  These areas were also boomed off to\\nprevent further impact.\\n\\nA wildlife reserve was located less than ten miles downstream from the dams at the\\nterminus and contingency plans were drafted to protect it.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nSan Joaquin Valley Crude oil has an API of 27.  When the oil entered the river it flowed\\ndownstream and left a sticky wet coating on everything that it touched.  Trees, shoreline,\\nwatercress, other vegetation, and rocks all remained coated with a bathtub-like ring\\nthroughout the response.\\n\\nThe oil pooled in calm areas of the river, most notably the areas in and around watercress\\npatches.  Not only would the oil impact the vegetation but it would pool in large quantities\\namong the roots.  Initially it was thought that cutting the vegetation in the river should be\\nkept to a minimum owing to the obtrusive nature of such an operation.  However, when it\\nwas discovered that large quantities of oil could be freed up for collection if the watercress\\nwas cut, a massive manual cutting and removal project ensued.  Once the vegetation was cut\\nit acted very much like an absorbent pompom so that by the time it reached a collection site\\ndownstream it was totally saturated with oil.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nSeveral different techniques were tried during this response to contain and collect the oil as\\nit moved down the river.  Some were effective, some met with limited success.\\n\\nOne technique involved setting up filter fences at a few locations along the river.  By the\\ntime fences were installed in the upper reaches, however, most of the recoverable oil had\\nalready traveled beyond those collection points, thereby making them rather ineffective.\\nFilter fences in the lower reaches, on the other hand, became so overwhelmed by the amount\\nof debris and oil that resulted from the vegetation cutting project that they became difficult\\nto keep unfouled and effective.\\n\\nDiversionary booming coupled with drum skimmers and vacuum trucks were located at\\ntwo points in the lower reaches.  Early in the response, when there was less debris in the\\nriver and the stream flow was lower, this technique was quite effective.\\n\\nThe river\\xe2\\x80\\x99s velocity and the shallow water depth made booming difficult.  The river\\xe2\\x80\\x99s depth\\nin many sections was a foot or less.  Six-inch harbor boom was used exclusively; if the boom\\ntouched the bottom, scouring occurred.  Scouring allowed oil and oily debris to entrain.\\nDecreasing the angle of the boom across the river was attempted several times and was only\\nmarginally successful in reducing the problem of scouring and entrainment.\\n\\n162\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nTwo underflow, earthen dams were located at the river\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terminus across the flood plain in\\nanticipation of an increased river flow should there be significant rainfall.  These dams were\\napproximately 5 meters (m) high by 8 m wide by 1,000 m long.  To prevent the river from\\nwandering out of the channel and across its floodplain (thereby impacting vast amounts of\\nnew vegetation) heavy machinery was used to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchannelize\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the river.  Large earthen berms\\nwere constructed along the shoreline of the lowest reach of the river, forcing the flow of the\\nriver towards the terminus.  Containment boom, vacuum trucks, and drum skimmers were\\nlocated at the terminus to collect any free-floating oil.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe USFWS was concerned about transporting collected oily debris along sections of the\\nriver that did not offer easy access to mechanical recovery equipment (e.g., front-end loaders\\nand dump trucks).  Should heavy machinery be allowed to transit the riverbed and\\npotentially damage habitat, or should cleanup crews make several round trips carrying 50-\\npound bags of  debris?  It was decided that a USFWS representative would remain on-scene\\nto decide on a case-by-case basis.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on January 19, 1994, by the FOSC who requested NOAA\\nsupport.  The SSC reported on-scene that evening and was requested by the FOSC to remain\\nin contact with FEMA and gather data on river flow and dam status, provide liaison for the\\nUSFWS, and attend evening planning meetings.  Additionally, the SSC consulted with the\\nU.S. Geological Survey regarding river-basin drainage information and sediment water-\\nholding capacity to provide insight as to how rainfall would affect stream flow.\\n\\nOwing to the weather-critical operations in the river, NOAA supplied daily weather\\nforecasts.\\n\\nA trajectory was provided with a caution issued because of the confined nature of a riverbed\\nand the capabilities of NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oil weathering model.  The computer program ADIOS\\nassumes that the oil has the ability to spread out on an open body of water.   Thus, using\\nADIOS  information to plot trajectories on a river where the oil may not spread out makes\\nthe evaporation rates suspect.\\n\\nDaily status maps of the various river segments were produced, indicating the respective\\noperations and resource allocations for each segment.\\n\\nThe SSC was on-scene for one week; NOAA continued supporting the cleanup operation\\nwith weather forecasts for six weeks.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.

The pipeline is used for several\\ntypes of light products such as gasoline and diesel.  A pinhole leak was the reason for the\\ndischarge and was most likely caused by third-party damage.  The leak occurred in an\\nindustrial area, apparently during a transition period in which gasoline and a diesel cutter\\nstock were moving through the pipeline, because both products were detected at the spill\\nsite.\\n\\nThe leak was located near a series of ditches that fed into a marsh next to Pacheco Slough.\\nPacheco Slough empties into and is located south of Suisun Bay.  Some of the leaked\\nproduct exited the marsh and went into Pacheco Slough via a culvert.  Clean Bay Inc.  was\\ncalled to the site and promptly installed boom to prevent any more product from exiting the\\nslough and affecting Suisun Bay.  Most of the product was located in a series of ditches near\\nthe leak.  Cleanup crews placed sorbent pads and booms in the ditches to collect as much\\nspilled product as possible.\\n\\nThe RWQCB was on-scene to ensure that water quality standards were being met.  Water\\nexiting the ditches had to meet RWQCB drinking water quality standards before entering\\nthe marsh.  A portable water treatment facility was brought on-scene to guarantee these\\nstandards.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nThe light products formed sheens and collected in small pools of pure product in some areas\\nwithin the drainage ditches.  Sheens were noted in the open-water areas of the marsh and\\ntraveled from side to side as the light wind shifted throughout the day.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nBooms were placed in Pacheco Slough near the culvert that leads to the marsh to prevent oil\\nfrom getting into Suisun Bay.

The Seki spilled 16,000 tons of Iranian\\nlight crude (API 33).  The slick traveled to the west and impacted approximately 30\\nkilometers (km) of the east coast of UAE.  No responsible party was determined so the\\nincident was treated as a third-party spill.\\n\\nThe UAE government requested assistance from the United States through the USCG\\nLiaison Officer, who, after assessing the situation, requested a team of advisors be sent to\\nUAE to help that government clean up the spill.  The three-member team was composed of\\nrepresentatives from the USCG Pacific Strike Team (PST), the EPA Office of Research and\\nDevelopment, and NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, Hazardous Materials Response and Assessment Division.\\n\\nThe U.S. Advisory Team (USAT) arrived in UAE on the afternoon of April 13, 1994, and\\nreceived a tour of the spill site by the USCG Liaison Officer and UAE environmental\\npersonnel.\\n\\n166\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nIranian light crude is an extremely light oil and 35 to 40 percent of the oil was predicted to\\nevaporate within the first five days of the spill.\\n\\nThe oil originally headed east, away from shore and out into the Gulf of Oman.  The\\nprevailing winds then dominated the oil\\xe2\\x80\\x99s movement and the slick changed directions 180\\xc2\\xb0\\nand impacted the east coast of the UAE.  When the USAT arrived on-scene, nearly all the oil\\nhad beached.\\n\\nThe shoreline types impacted were medium- and coarse-grain sand, cobble, boulder/riprap,\\nand vertical rock walls.  During the first couple of days of shoreline response, 3,500 cubic\\nmeters of oiled surface sand was removed manually from the beaches.  However, during the\\nensuing days the sand beaches experienced a depositional period burying layers of fresh oil.\\nThe layers of oil were found as deep as 50 centimeters (cm) and ranged from 5 to 15 cm\\nthick.\\n\\nA major concern for the responders was that the beaches had experienced a depositional\\nphase after being impacted by the oil.  Lenses of thick oil were buried as deep as a half a\\nmeter on some beaches.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe largest concern for the responders was how to remove the heavy concentrations of oil\\nburied in the sediment.  The shoreline survey team, composed of the NOAA SSC, a\\nrepresentative from the CEDRE (France\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Research and Documentation Center For\\nAccidental Water Pollution), and occasionally a local government representative, identified\\napproximately 25 km of impact within the UAE border (there were reports that the northern\\ntip of the peninsula, Omani territory, had also been oiled) of which 14 km were sandy\\nbeaches.  Roughly 6 to 8 km of these beaches had buried lenses of heavily oiled sediment.\\nThe clean sand overburden ranged from 10 to 50 cm.  The lenses were approximately 10 to\\n15 m wide and from 5 to 10 cm thick.\\n\\nThe USAT had explained the pros and cons of various mitigation techniques to the UAE\\nofficials.  The options discussed were:\\n\\np Beach flushing, either manually or by some type of mechanized system;\\n\\np  Berm relocation;\\n\\np Sediment removal/treatment and replacement;\\n\\np Sediment removal and replacement; and\\n\\np Sediment removal without any renourishment of the beach.\\n\\nSeveral beach-flushing tests were performed using high-pressure hoses and trenching to\\nagitate the sand and free up the oil, causing it to flow into a series of trenches leading to a\\ncollection point in the lower intertidal zone.  This system was not very successful because:\\n\\np Operating hoses manually limited the size of the swath and prevented effective\\n\\nmobilization of the oil;\\n\\n167\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\np Collecting the oil in the lower intertidal area limited the amount of time that the\\n\\noperation could be performed; and\\n\\np Collecting the free-floating oil using trenches was not effective.\\n\\nThe next operation to be tested was an Excavator (a tracked vehicle with a bucket that has a\\n15-m reach) fitted with a series of hoses.  The idea was that flushing could be conducted\\nwith this extension arm at the water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edge during a rising tide.  The freed oil would then be\\nallowed to flow with the long shore transport to a collection point.  The collection point\\nwould consist of a shore-barrier boom that would herd the oil into a basin dug into the sand.\\nA skimmer would then be used to remove the collected oil into a holding tank.  At the time\\nof the USAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure, this technique had not been effective because of undersized\\npumps.\\n\\nA trial berm relocation was attempted on April 20.  One hundred meters of heavily oiled\\nsandy shoreline were bulldozed into the water at low tide.  This method released large\\nquantities of oil very effectively, but created a 2.5-km dark brown plume along the\\nshoreline.  Local fishermen complained about the plume and the technique was abandoned.\\n\\nFor the beaches that had a lesser degree of oiling, several techniques were tried including\\nberm relocation, disking, and disking with nutrient enhancement.\\n\\nCobble beaches, boulder/riprap, and vertical rock walls that were heavily impacted posed\\nless of a problem because the viable techniques were somewhat limited.  Some of the\\ntechniques being discussed when the USAT departed were the application of Inipol,\\nnutrient enhancement, and steam cleaning.\\n\\nA 10- by 10-m test plot on a wave-cut platform with an armoring of well-rounded cobble\\nwas set aside for the use of Inipol.  The substrate was heavily coated with oil.  The Inipol\\nwas applied the day before the USAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure.  A monitoring plan was drafted by the\\nEPA and left with UAE officials.\\n\\nSteam cleaning was approved in the small fishing harbor of Dadnah, where 200 m of riprap,\\na boat ramp, and fishing vessels were heavily impacted.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe effects on this section of the UAE coast concerned the local governments because of a\\nbudding tourism industry.  Most of the impacted area was pristine coastline and a few of\\nthe resorts complained of a marked decrease in patronage.  Fishing villages along the coast\\nalso suffered from this spill because the local government instituted a ban on all fish and\\nseafood caught from these waters.  Local fishermen complained that the fish caught had an\\noily taste.\\n\\nWhile the USAT was on-scene, no impact to wildlife was reported.  Considering the size of\\nthe spill, this was noteworthy.\\n\\nA small test burn was conducted by the beach cleanup team in one of the collection trenches\\nduring a flushing test.  Gasoline was poured onto the pooled product and ignited by hand.\\nThis technique did not prove to be effective because the oil was apparently too weathered to\\nburn well.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\n168\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the spill by the USCG and requested to report on-scene.\\nRepresentatives from NOAA, EPA, and the USCG arrived at the spill site the afternoon of\\nApril 13, 1994.  The USAT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s major functions at this spill were to observe and provide advice\\nto the UAE government.  The USAT attended planning and operational meetings daily.  The\\nUSAT provided the responders with the following informational documents:\\n\\np an operations plan for cleaning the small fishing harbor in Dadnah;\\n\\np a Daily Site Information Form to be used by beach foremen to report on work\\n\\nprogress at the daily meetings;\\n\\np a Shoreline Options Paper that rated the various beach types by their degree of oiling\\n\\nand explained various countermeasures that could be used and their pros and cons;\\nand\\n\\np a Long-Term Strategic Plan to be used by the command to identify strategic goals.\\n\\nTeam member efforts were as follows;\\n\\nThe USCG, aside from being in charge of the overall operation of the USAT, was very\\ninfluential in instituting an Incident Command System.  When the USAT arrived there was\\nno apparent organization and the responders were finding it difficult to obtain permission\\nto conduct activities.  The need for a centralized command system was great because this\\nspill response spanned several nations and cultures.  From the United Kingdom there was\\nITOPF, Oil Spill Service Center, and Warren Springs Laboratory.  From France there was a\\nrepresentative from CEDRE.  There were representatives from the UAE government, the\\nEmirate of Fujaira, and the Port of Fujaira.  The cleanup workers were Indian, Pakistani, and\\nBengali.\\n\\nThe USCG also explained the importance of cost documentation and provided necessary\\ntraining to government officials.\\n\\nEPA was very helpful in fielding questions from various vendors that purveyed mitigation\\nproducts.  Roughly 60 vendors called the command post or the U.S. Embassy trying to sell\\nvarious cleaning and bioremediation agents.  The EPA representative in charge of the Inipol\\ntest site wrote a monitoring plan to determine the product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effectiveness and worked with\\nthe UAE government to establish long-term analytical sampling protocols.\\n\\nNOAA provided shoreline assessment maps from information obtained during surveys\\ndone in conjunction with CEDRE.  The SSC also provided examples of documents from past\\nspills on determining \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow-clean-is-clean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and provided daily weather reports and tidal\\ninformation to the command.\\n\\nBefore departing the country, the USAT debriefed the UAE\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Minister of Health and the U.S.\\nAmbassador in the capital city of Dubai.  The USAT departed the scene on April 26, 1994.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.  ADIOS\\xe2\\x84\\xa2 (Automated Data Inquiry for Oil Spills) User\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Manual.

The diluent, which is a mid-grade condensate product, had been injected\\ninto the production wells throughout recent decades to increase the yield from the oilfield.\\nFor economic reasons, the practice of injecting diluent into the wells replaced the use of\\nsteam during the 1950s.  UNOCAL stopped injecting diluent by 1990.  Either through poor\\ninjection practices or through a faulty pipeline system, diluent was released into the field in\\nlarge quantities.  Current estimates are that there may be as much as 8.5 million gallons of\\ndiluent located in various plumes throughout the 2,300-acre site.  The diluent plumes are\\nbelow ground, riding on top of the water table.\\n\\nThe Guadalupe site borders the Pacific Ocean and is located in the expansive dune fields\\nsouth of San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach.  It is located just north of the Santa Maria River,\\nthe border between San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties.  UNOCAL is in the process\\nof closing down the field as part of their overall plan to abandon all operations in California.\\n\\nThe USCG MSO at Los Angeles/Long Beach, along with the  State of California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office of\\nOil Spill Prevention and Response, decided to respond to one plume in particular that was\\n\\n171\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nlocated in the intertidal zone and was the source of diluent releases into the nearshore\\nenvironment during winter storms and high tides.  The USCG COTP ordered UNOCAL to\\nrespond to the plume on July 15, 1994.  UNOCAL prepared an Incident Action Plan that\\ninvolved excavation of the contaminated sand, removal of all free product from the pit, and\\nthen backfilling the site with clean and/or treated sand.  This particular plume was\\noriginally estimated to consist of 1.5 million gallons of diluent.  UNOCAL in recent years\\nhas been using extraction wells to prevent the plume from migrating any farther into the\\nintertidal zone.  UNOCAL estimates that they have removed roughly 700,000 gallons of\\ndiluent using these wells.  Recently, owing to the holding capacity of the sediment, the\\nexcavation operations were limited to only a few barrels of product a day.  It was estimated\\nthat as much as 800,000 gallons of diluent still remain in the plume and the continued use of\\nthe excavation wells would not have been practicable.\\n\\nThe plume was cone-shaped and oriented east to west (with the narrow end of the cone\\npointed to the east, away from the ocean).  The cone was approximately 800 feet from east to\\nwest and 800 feet from north to south at its widest point.  It ranged from the supratidal zone\\n(eastern edge) to the edge of the upper intertidal zone (western edge) during the summer\\nmonths when the beach is in a depositional phase.  (It is important to note that this beach\\nexhibits dramatic seasonal changes from summer to winter.  Two surveys conducted in 1992\\nshowed that the winter beach was 40 to 50 m narrower than the summer beach.)  The plume\\nwas buried under a sand layer that varies in depth across the intertidal zone.  To the west\\n(closer to the high-tide berm) the burial was only a few feet, whereas the eastern edge of the\\nplume was buried to a depth of approximately 12 feet.\\n\\nOnly the western 40 percent of the plume (the area most likely to be impacted by winter\\nstorms) was to be excavated during this response.  The rest of this particular plume will be\\npart of the long-term remediation project that will be undertaken for the entire Guadalupe\\nfield by the EPA.  The intent of this project was to remove the immediate threat of releases\\nto the nearshore environment.  The remainder of the field will be considered a long-term\\nremediation site and will require an Environmental Impact Statement, under NEPA, as well\\nas an Environmental Impact Report, which is required under state statute.  This project,\\nconsidered to be an emergency response, required neither of the two studies.\\n\\nUNOCAL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan included building a cofferdam around the section of the plume to be\\nexcavated using sheet metal pilings driven down below the water table.  The pilings were\\n30- and 40-feet high and driven in so they were just a few feet above the existing grade of\\nthe beach.  The cofferdam was roughly the shape of a rectangle (800 feet by 300 feet, with the\\nlonger axis running north and south) and was designed to encircle the excavation site to\\nprevent any communication with the sea during the operation.\\n\\nThe excavation plan was conducted in four phases:\\n\\np The clean sand overburden was removed and placed in holding areas located on the\\n\\nbeaches north and south of the excavation site (approximately 25,000 cubic yards).\\n\\np The contaminated sand was removed and taken to a stockpile area where it was\\nthermally treated to remove the contamination.  At the same time, UNOCAL also\\nremoved a slurry wall that was installed in 1990.  The slurry wall had been installed\\nin an earlier attempt to halt the westward migration of the plume, but had been\\nineffective.\\n\\np The pit that was created by the excavation was cleaned of all free-floating product\\n\\n(the excavation went below the water table, creating a lake inside the cofferdam)\\nusing weir skimmers.\\n\\n172\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\np *The pit was to be back-filled with clean sand from the thermally treated sand or\\n\\nfrom some alternative source, and a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) barrier\\ninstalled.  The HDPE wall runs from north to south and is located at the eastern end\\nof the excavation site.  The barrier is intended to prevent any migration of the\\nremaining plume into the cleaned excavation site.  Once the pit is completely\\nbackfilled, the sheet-piling cofferdam will be removed.\\n\\nThe total amount of sand excavated was estimated at 150,000 cubic yards, of which 25,000\\ncubic yards was considered the clean overburden.  Two thermal units were brought on-\\nscene to treat the contaminated sand.  The thermal units are designed to heat the sand to\\nabout 800\\xc2\\xb0F and thereby thermally remove the hydrocarbon contamination.  The sand\\nexiting the thermal units was sampled and determined to be below the detection level for\\ntotal petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH).  The level of contamination approved by the Regional\\nWater Quality Control Board is 30 parts per million of TPH.\\n\\nCombined, the thermal units have a rated output of 150 tons per hour.  There are\\napproximately 1.4 cubic yards of sand per ton.  This calculates to over two months of\\ncontinuous treatment at optimum conditions.  As of December 1994, there were 80,000 cubic\\nyards of treated sand available for backfill and approximately 50,000 cubic yards yet to be\\ntreated.\\n\\nThe major issues regarding the impact to wildlife were the endangered snowy plover and\\nbrown pelican, and the threatened California least tern.  Plovers and terns use this stretch of\\nbeach for nesting.  The nesting season runs from mid-spring to late summer.  The project\\nwas originally designed to take place between the nesting season and the winter storm\\nperiod.  The COTP received a Section 7 consultation from the USFWS for this project.  The\\npermit allowed accidental \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but required that there be twenty-four hour wildlife\\nobservations to insure that there were no impacts.  The largest concern was whether the\\nbirds would be affected when there was free-floating product in the excavation pit.  Propane\\ncannons were used to discourage birds from landing in the contaminated standing water in\\nthe pit.\\n\\nNone of the previous winter releases had resulted in major wildlife impacts.  However,\\nsome sampling of surf fish immediately following a release showed that there had been\\nsome hydrocarbon contamination.  Organoleptic testing was performed on fish caught in\\nthe area near the UNOCAL site and a control site near Morro Bay to the north.  The fish\\ncaught near the plume had a detectable oily odor or taste and the County Environmental\\nHealth Department issued a warning to recreational fishermen.\\n\\nThese operations began in September 1994 and will continue into early 1995.\\n\\nBehavior of Spilled Material:\\n\\nDiluent is a cheap mid-grade product and was apparently not homogeneous over the\\ndecades that it was utilized in oilfield operations.  According to a UNOCAL report, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiluent\\nis the middle cut off the distillation process.  It is very much like a light crude, except that\\nthe lighter materials such as propane and butane have been removed as have the heavier\\ncomponents, such as the oils that go into making asphalt or fuel oils.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  The product, in its\\noriginal form, ranged from light to dark brown.  When it was released into the surf zone in\\n\\n*  At the time of this writing, the last phase is still in progress.\\n\\n173\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nthe winter it formed sheens that were not recoverable.  The impacts to the neighboring\\nshorelines were minimal.  Reports stated that the only evidence of a release was a\\ndiscoloration of the high tide swash line.\\n\\nAs the diluent was being released into the pit during the excavation, it formed into thick\\naccumulations of nearly pure product.  Foss Environmental from Long Beach, California\\nprovided weir skimmers for the operation.  Skimming operations were underway for\\nroughly two weeks and recovered approximately 815 barrels of diluent.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nOpen-water recovery operations took place in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that was formed during the\\nexcavation.  Responders used weir skimmers to remove the free-floating product.  The rest\\nof the spilled material was removed from the site in the form of approximately 130,000 cubic\\nyards of contaminated sand and was thermally treated.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThere was a large amount of public concern over this operation.  Many of the local public\\ninterest groups were arguing that the methodology chosen was far too obtrusive.  They\\nrequested UNOCAL to use less invasive measures (i.e., in-situ, long-term remediation\\ntechniques).  In several public meetings, the operational plan was defended by the members\\nof the Unified Command as being the only alternative given the desire to remove the threat\\nof contamination before another winter storm season.  Owing to the strict control over the\\naccess to the site, two local monitors were chosen to be the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceyes on-scene\\xe2\\x80\\x9d during\\nthe operation.  These monitors were given access to the entire site as well as all Incident\\nCommand meetings and reported periodically to the public interest groups.\\n\\nAdditionally, there was much concern over the safety and health of the citizens of the town\\nof Guadalupe.  Guadalupe is a small, mostly Spanish-speaking farming community located\\nfive miles from the excavation site.  UNOCAL assured the citizens that they would hold\\nregular town meetings, publish periodic summaries on the work being performed in the\\nlocal newspapers, and all communications with the community would be done in English\\nand Spanish.  UNOCAL also assured that they would, along with county officials and the\\nRegional Air Quality Control Board, be monitoring for any harmful pollutants in and\\naround the area.\\n\\nThe operations took place on a section of coastline that is used for recreation, fishing, and\\nsurfing.  About one mile of beach was closed during the cleanup.  The land to the north of\\nthe site was managed by the California Coastal Conservancy; the land to the south of the site\\nwas managed by the Nature Conservancy.  The Coastal Conservancy holds a future \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\nto lease\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agreement for the section of beach that was affected by the plume.  Recreational\\nfishing was impacted when organoleptic testing of surf fish caught in the area showed signs\\nof contamination.  The County Office of Environmental Health issued a warning to the\\nfishermen not to eat any fish caught in the surf around the UNOCAL lease site.\\n\\nBefore the pit was to be backfilled the Unified Command requested permission of the RRT\\nto use a fertilizer called Max Bac.  UNOCAL considered the fertilizer a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolishing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d agent.\\nAfter a conference call on October 27, the RRT agreed to allow the use of Max Bac.\\nHowever, the State of California\\xe2\\x80\\x99s representative to the conference call was not empowered\\nto make the decision for the State.  The State withheld its vote and requested additional\\ninformation regarding the nutrient requirements of the pit.  Since this information was not\\nreadily available, the Unified Command withdrew its request and the Max Bac was not\\napplied to the site.\\n\\n174\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\nDuring the initial planning and initiation of the excavation, the issue of the effectiveness of\\nthe removal action was raised.  The NOAA Trustee was concerned about the effectiveness of\\nthe excavation and requested that UNOCAL ensure that bioavailable diluent did not remain\\nin the environment.  After many discussions that included the SSC, NOAA Trustee, USFWS,\\nUNOCAL, FOSC, and CF&G, the following plan of action was agreed:\\n\\n1. UNOCAL agreed to share all data that was gathered prior to the beginning of the\\n\\noperations.\\n\\n2. UNOCAL provided the trustees additional sand crab studies to be performed\\n\\nsubsequent to the completion of the project.\\n\\n3. UNOCAL and NOAA agreed to some form of monitoring to determine whether bio-\\navailable diluent was still present in the environment. Resolution of this issue is still\\npending.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was involved with the operation since March 1994 when MSO Los Angeles/ Long\\nBeach decided to undertake removal action of the intertidal plume.  NOAA wrote to the\\nCaptain of the Port discussing the pros and cons of the operational plan.  The letter detailed\\nthe need to remove the threat of contamination and explained that the option to excavate the\\nbeach was the preferred method given the stated time constraints.\\n\\nThe SSC arrived on-scene on September 1, 1994, and remained until September 19; however,\\nwhile operations continued, NOAA provided advice and assistance on various topics as\\nneeded (e.g., water table migration, bioremediation).\\n\\nDuring the operation the SSC was tasked to ensure that the requirements of the Section 7\\npermit were being met and assist in the dialogue between the Unified Command and the\\nUSFWS.  The Unified Command also requested that NOAA help develop a plan that\\nidentified alternate sources of sand had it become unfeasible to use the thermally treated\\nsand.  The Unified Command was faced with an original completion deadline of October 15.\\nA Sand Source Site Team (SSST) was formed and composed of representatives from\\nUNOCAL, CF&G, USFWS, and geomorphologists from the California Coastal Conservancy\\nand San Luis Obispo County.  The team was organized and led by the SSC.\\n\\nNOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on-scene personnel helped the SSST identify sites, discuss various options, and\\nreview sand-grain reports.  The sand-grain reports indicated the overfill ratio of individual\\nsources of sand.  The overfill ratio of a particular source is the amount of sand that would\\nneed to be added to the beach to not only replace the sand that had been excavated, but to\\nallow for the loss of the finer materials (if present) to wind and wave erosion.  Alternate\\nsources of sand would not typically be composed of the same materials in the same ratio as\\nthe sand on the beach.  For example, a sand source with an overfill ratio of 1.5 would require\\none and one half times the amount of replacement sand as was originally removed.  The\\ntheory is that once erosion had taken place there would be a 100 percent replacement of the\\nproper-sized sand back on the beach.\\n\\nThe SSST presented a paper to the Unified Command discussing the various options along\\nwith their associated pros and cons.  The team developed the following seven options for\\nreturning the sand to the pit:\\n\\n1.\\n\\nleaving the pit open to allow for natural renourishment;\\n\\n175\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 11\\n\\n2. partially opening the cofferdam to allow natural renourishment;\\n\\n3. dredging from offshore;\\n\\n4. commercial sources;\\n\\n5.\\n\\nscraping sand from other beaches;\\n\\n6. borrowing from large sand dunes located on the UNOCAL-leased property; or\\n\\n7. a combination of options 5  and  6.\\n\\nThe SSST recommended #7, contingent upon the permit process that would be required to\\nremove sand from either of the two sites.  Of course these options were only to be\\nconsidered if the thermally treated sand could not be put back into the pit.  Replacing the\\nthermally treated sand, provided it could meet water quality standards, was the best option.\\n\\nThe Unified Command decided to allow the completion deadline to be pushed back as long\\nas the integrity of the wall was not being compromised by winter storms.  This allowed the\\nmaximum replacement of the thermally treated sand without using alternate sources.  The\\noptions outlined by the SSST are being held in reserve as a contingency.\\n\\nAs part of a requirement  for the permit issued by the California Coastal Commission,\\nNOAA also outlined a plan to monitor the integrity of the beach after the operation was\\ncompleted and to ensure that the mouth of the Santa Maria River was not migrating.  In\\n1943 the mouth of the river had migrated to the North and swept through the area now\\nbeing excavated. RPI suggested that UNOCAL hire a surveyor to establish permanent\\nmarkers above the high-tide line and that the river mouth and the excavation site be\\nsurveyed every two months.\\n\\nNOAA provided weather reports three times a week from the beginning of the operation\\nuntil October 31.  The Unified Command was particularly interested in long-range weather\\nforecasts because of the operation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s susceptibility to large winter storms.  If given enough\\nforewarning of a potentially large storm, the Unified Command was prepared to remove all\\nthe equipment from the pit and build a sand berm in front of the western wall of the\\ncofferdam.  If warranted, they were also prepared to remove the cofferdam completely and\\nfill the pit with sand from sources  outlined in the SSST report.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.

The An Ping 6 was at anchor in the Columbia River at the time of the\\nincident.  The responsible party estimated that  3,000 gallons ran off the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deck and\\ninto the water.  The heaviest sheens extended eight miles downriver.  Active and passive\\nshoreline cleanup continued for several weeks.  Approximately 78 vessels, 12 floating\\nhomes, and 50 other floating structures were oiled and had to be cleaned.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe movement of oil in the spill area was dominated by river flow and southerly winds.\\nFarther downriver,  oil movement was more tidally influenced and during ebb tides tended\\nto move at a faster rate.  During the spill, flow rates at the Bonneville Dam were monitored\\nfor input into trajectory predictions  (130,000 to 150,000 cubic feet per second during the\\nspill).  As a result of southerly winds, almost all shoreline impacts occurred on the\\nWashington shoreline.  The greatest impacts were to Fisher Island, Hump Island, and in the\\nFisher Slough.  Sheens were seen as far as the Huntington Islands downriver from the spill\\nsite.\\n\\nDue to the  physical properties of the oil (specific gravity of 0.99, API of 11.3, pour point 30\\xc2\\xb0\\nF) it was predicted to be very persistent in nature, form tarballs, and become widely\\ndispersed.  Because of the high specific gravity of the oil,  there was concern that the oil\\nmight incorporate river sediment and sink.  The Washington Department of Ecology (DOE)\\ndid some bottom sampling for oil during the spill; however, no observable evidence of oil\\nwas found.\\n\\n183\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 13\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe majority of the free-floating oil traveled downriver spreading into broken patches of\\nsheen.  Protective booming was the primary countermeasure  and approximately 8,400 feet\\nof hard boom was used during the spill.  Boom was used to protect sensitive priority areas\\nand to collect oil in Fisher Island Slough.  The majority of oil collected in the Fisher Slough\\nwas along the shoreline, under floating homes, trapped around boats, and in marsh areas.\\nAfter containing the 2,000 gallons that remained on the deck, the vessel was also cleaned.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nNOAA was asked by the FOSC to look at the potential environmental effects from using\\nPES-51 a shoreline cleaner classified as a miscellaneous oil spill agent.   The responsible\\nparty requested that it be allowed to clean boat hulls while still in the water.  PES-51 was\\nevaluated by NOAA  based on chemistry, aquatic toxicity, effectiveness, and personal\\nobservations from two recent field tests.  It was concluded that PES-51 fell somewhere in the\\nmiddle ground of the effectiveness/toxicity equation for cleaners.  PES 51 is consistently\\nmore toxic than other shoreline cleaning products with similar solubility (e.g., Corexit 9580).\\nNOAA recommended evaluating a variety of products to obtain the best available balance\\nbetween maximum effectiveness and minimum environmental impact.  The responsible\\nparty eventually used PES-51 by applying it by rag and immediately wiping it off to\\nminimize the amount reaching the water.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident at 0900 on January 10, 1994, and was requested to\\nprovide assistance on-scene.  The SSC provided technical information on the spill trajectory,\\nweather forecasts, resources at risk, tides, currents, spill mapping, and shoreline cleanup\\nrecommendations.  Of primary concern was the health of individuals living aboard floating\\nhomes in Fisher Slough after exposure to the strong oil vapors.  These floating homes were\\nsurrounded by oil and residents were encouraged to leave until the vapors subsided.\\n\\nThroughout the response, NOAA participated in helicopter mapping overflights and multi-\\nagency shoreline surveys.  Cleanup recommendations were provided for the more sensitive\\nenvironments.  The SSC worked closely with the trustee agencies to evaluate the tradeoffs\\nbetween the need to contain and remove trapped oil in sensitive environments along the\\nriver and the impact these cleanup activities might cause to nesting populations and marsh\\nhabitats.  Special attention was given to Fisher Island.  Oiled willow trees overhanging the\\nwater were heavily oiled and were a threat to the nesting blue heron and other birds.  Oiled\\nwillow branches were cut to prevent future contamination of wildlife.\\n\\nNOAA tested samples of the spilled oil for oil chemistry and weathering properties.  Gas\\nchromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) characterization suggested that this oil would\\nbe very persistent in the environment.  Samples collected from Fisher Slough exhibited only\\na slight reduction in the alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons after two and a half days of\\nweathering.  NOAA also performed a weathering experiment to address  the possibility the\\noil might sink.  After 264 hours of weathering, the oil did not sink.  This experiment did not\\ninclude the possibility of oil sinking from sedimentation.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nHoff, Rebecca, ed. 1994.

The\\nmaterial ran into drains that emptied into a nearby marsh connected to the Duwamish\\nWaterway through an underground drainage pipe and culvert.  The spill was discovered by\\nfacility employees the following morning and reported to the National Response Center by\\n0945.  Spilled material had spread into a nearby marsh, and by 1300 was observed escaping\\nfrom a culvert near Terminal 115 into the Duwamish Waterway.\\n\\nContainment and cleanup were begun by 1100 on February 15.  By February 16 most of the\\nfree-floating product was recovered using vacuum trucks and absorbents.  Cleanup of the\\ncontaminated soils at the original spill site and passive absorption of sheens tidally flushing\\nout of the contaminated drainage pipe between the marsh and the Duwamish Waterway\\ncontinued until February 21.  The USCG pollution case was closed on February 23.\\n\\nBehavior of Product:\\n\\nThe 5,000 gallons of product spilled consisted of less than 10 percent various waste solvents\\nmixed with waste diesel/hydraulic oils and 30 percent water.  The product was being\\nformulated by Northwest Enviro Service for sale as a recycled high BTU fuel product for\\nindustrial boilers.  Organic analysis of the mixture remaining in the rail tank car indicated\\nxylene, toluene, 2 butanone (MEK) were present at concentrations around two percent, with\\nlower concentrations of acetone, isobutanol, benzene, ethylbenzene, and r-methyl-2-\\npentanone (MIBK).  Heavy metal contaminants also detected in the mixture included\\nbarium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, and selenium.  The material was bright red\\nand floated in fresh water.\\n\\nThe material spread quickly through the adjacent marsh during the morning of February 15.\\nThe marsh was tidally influenced through at least one direct connection to the Duwamish\\nWaterway or possibly tidally influenced changes on the water table level.  During low tide,\\npockets of bright red material collected in the main drainage channel on the west side of the\\nmarsh and a smaller low lying depression along the southeast corner of the marsh.  During\\n\\n187\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 13\\n\\nthe ebb, bright red product was flushed out through  an underground drainage pipe and\\nculvert leading from the marsh to the Duwamish Waterway near Terminal 115.  Overflights\\nconducted the first two days of the spill observed only light unrecoverable sheen extending\\ndown to the vicinity of Kellogg Island.  The quantity flushed out with each ebb tide\\ndecreased to less than a gallon by the end of the second day, but sheens continued to be\\nflushed out until February 21.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nThe valves on the tank car were secured upon discovery.  Straw bales and boom were\\ndeployed at the drain leaving the spill site to prevent further migration into the marsh.\\nOnce the criminal investigation cleared the scene, the portable rail tank was moved and\\nsurrounding soil and asphalt dug up and removed until product no longer leached out of an\\nadjacent soil bank.\\n\\nSeattle METRO conducted dye tests to trace the points of discharge and confirmed there\\nwere no other connections to the Duwamish Waterway.  Vacuum trucks were used to\\nremove pockets of free-floating material in the wetland and at the drainage pipe discharge\\nculvert near Terminal 112.  This was most effective in the wetland during low tide when\\nmuch of the material was collected in the drainage channel along the highway where crews\\nhad access with the vacuum hoses.  The culverts draining water from the marsh to the\\nDuwamish Waterway were blocked with booms and straw bales and the collected product\\nactively removed by vacuum.  Most of the free-floating oil in the marsh and at Terminal 112\\nwas removed by the end of the second day.  Passive absorption of sheens resulting from\\ntidal flushing of the drainage pipe and product trapped in the wetland vegetation using\\nabsorbent sweeps continued until February 21.\\n\\nOn February 23, the Washington State Department of Transportation (owners of the\\ncontaminated marsh) and the Washington DOE assumed responsibility for coordinating\\nwith the responsible party on the long-term remediation and restoration of the marsh area.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe spill occurred in the U.S. EPA zone of responsibility; but due to the threat of\\ncontamination to the Duwamish Waterway, the USCG was the first Federal official on-scene\\nand ultimately assumed responsibility as the FOSC.  This incident has led to a re-evaluation\\nof the Memorandum of Agreement between EPA and the USCG and may result in\\nredefining the boundary between their response zones.\\n\\n188\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 13\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified at 1100 on February 15, 1994, and was requested to provide assistance\\non-scene.  NOAA provided daily weather reports for cleanup activities and information on\\nwetland tidal dynamics;  participated in overflights, shoreline surveys, and daily\\noperational briefings; and provided routine response updates to the U.S. Department of the\\nInterior, Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, Washington State trustees, and NOAA trustees.\\n\\nThe NOAA Health and Safety Officer provided recommendations on permitted exposure\\nlevels, personal protective equipment, and toxicity and monitoring for specific solvent\\ncomponents reported to be in the mixture.  In response to these recommendations, air\\nmonitoring was conducted by an EPA Technical Assistance Team and cleanup workers\\ninvolved in vacuum recovery of free-floating product from the marsh and culverts worked\\nin Level C equipment (respirators with organic cartridges).\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nP 152357Z, COGARD MSO PUGET SOUND WA, Polrep One, Mixed Waste Solvents N.O.S.\\n(Toluene, Xylene, Heavy Metals and Water Mixture), Minor, 5,000 Gallons, Railroad Tank\\nCar, Duwamish Waterway, MC94003149.\\n\\nP 011959Z MAR 94, COGARD MSO PUGET SOUND WA, Polrep Six and Final, Mixed\\nWaste Solvents N.O.S.

A USCG helicopter overflight at first light reported what appeared to\\nbe a substantial quantity of cleanable oil in and around Tenasillahe Island from Columbia\\nRiver mile 38 downriver to approximately river mile 25.  The Columbia River islands\\ndownriver of Tenasillahe are part of the Lewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge.  Based\\non observations and the area at risk, a significant response was launched.  Cleanup\\ncontractors were directed to deploy the protection booming  between Puget Island and the\\nmouth of the Columbia River identified in the Northwest Area Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Columbia River\\nGeographical Response Plan.  Skimmers and contractor response vessels were mobilized.\\n\\nSubsequent overflights and surface surveys (shore and water) over the next two days failed\\nto detect significant concentrations of oil anywhere in the previously identified locations.\\nLight staining of marsh vegetation and widely scattered tarballs (.25 inch diameter) were\\nobserved along small sections of shoreline within the Lewis and Clark National Wildlife\\nRefuge.  A small section of sand and riprap shoreline near Hunts Mill Point (upriver\\nentrance to Clifton Channel) had moderate oiling that was manually removed.  Cleanup was\\ncompleted on August 12.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe USCG overflight at 0815 on August 10 reported two slicks.  The slick in the main\\nchannel north of Tenasillahe Island at river mile 35 was described as 1 mile by 700 yards\\nconsisting of heavy sheen and patches of black oil.  A second slick, 0.5 mile by 300 yards,\\nwas located south of Tenasillahe Island.\\n\\nThe USCG concluded that the product was bilge slops consisting of primarily intermediate\\nfuel oil, probably discharged the evening of August 9 by a passing vessel.  The calm winds,\\ncool temperatures, and fog resulted in the spill remaining as a cohesive slick in the area until\\nthe following morning when the turbulence and evaporation created by the wind, sun, and\\ncurrent caused it to rapidly dissipate.  This is consistent with NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hindcast trajectory\\nthat the spill probably occurred east of Tenasillahe Island and was subsequently split into\\ntwo slicks moving through the main channel and Clifton Channel.  As predicted, light sheen\\n\\n191\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 13\\n\\nwas observed in the vicinity of Horseshoe Island and Woody Island Channel in the early\\nafternoon of August 10.  No free-floating oil or sheen was observed after August 11.\\n\\nBoat surveys on August 11 identified a lightly to moderately impacted section of shoreline\\nnear Hunts Mill Point.  Manual cleanup was conducted August 12.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nPrimary cleanup consisted of manual removal of tarballs from a small section of sand and\\ngravel beach near Hunts Mill Point.  Approximately 1,000 feet of snare boom was deployed\\nto control sheening from oiled riprap adjacent to this beach.   Fifty gallons of emulsified\\nblack oil was collected by skimmer off Aldrich Point.\\n\\nJoint shoreline surveys by NOAA, USCG, Oregon DEQ, Washington DOE, and USFWS\\nwere conducted August 11.  Light staining of marsh vegetation and widely scattered tarballs\\n(less than .25 inch diameter) were observed along the outer shoreline of several islands\\nwithin the refuge.  No cleanup of these areas was the joint recommendations of the survey\\nmembers.  Joint survey by NOAA, USCG and Oregon DEQ on August 12 recommended no\\nfurther active cleanup required, but did recommend snare booms along the contaminated\\nriprap at Hunts Mill Point be maintained and monitored for another week.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nPotential threat to the Lewis and Clark National Wildlife Refuge required close coordination\\namong unified command, refuge manager, and USFWS biologists to identify impacts and\\nmake cleanup recommendations.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified at 0915 on August 10, 1994, and was requested to provide assistance on-\\nscene. NOAA provided the initial trajectory analysis and probable location of discharge and\\nparticipated in overflights, shoreline assessments, and evening operational briefings.

Over this six-week period, cleanup crews composed of\\nMakah tribal members and cleanup contractors recovered 2,100 pounds of tarballs.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nTarballs were washed ashore on Olympic Peninsula beaches over the six-week period by a\\nprolonged period of onshore winds.  Shoreline impacts were sporadic, generally limited to\\nlocalized accumulations on small, isolated pocket beaches, and found at all different levels\\nof the intertidal area.  These localized areas of accumulations were generally made up of\\nquarter- to baseball-sized tarballs.  However, on April 14 a tar paddy two feet in diameter\\nweighing over 250 pounds was recovered from Duk Point, as well as an additional 150\\npounds of softball- to volleyball-sized tarballs from a 50-yard stretch of beach.\\n\\nIllegal or accidental discharges of petroleum product from vessel traffic transiting along the\\nWest Coast occur year round.  Weather patterns in the late winter and early spring favor the\\ndevelopment of periods of strong onshore winds capable of moving such oil from 10 to 50\\nmiles offshore onto the beaches all along the coast from Canada to California.   GC/MS\\nanalyses of samples collected from the beaches indicated that the tarballs were composed of\\nvarious types of oil from multiple sources.  Samples collected and analyzed during the first\\nweeks of the spill by Washington DOE indicated a refined product similar to Bunker C from\\nat least two sources.  Samples collected in mid-April by the USCG and analyzed by NOAA\\nindicated an unrefined product similar to Alaska North Slope crude with an enriched high\\nmolecular weight wax content indicative of residuals from cleaning tanker holds or tank\\nsludge discharge.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nSmall work crews manually picked up the tarballs, placed them in plastic bags, and airlifted\\nthe bags off the beaches by helicopters.\\n\\n194\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 13\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe remote location of most of the impacted beaches, the sporadic beach impacts, and the\\nnecessity to time access and cleanup activity with the tides made shoreline assessment and\\ncleanup very difficult, time consuming, and costly.  Impacts to tribal land and National Park\\nlands required close coordination among the USCG, Makah Tribal representatives, and\\nOlympic National Park rangers.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was requested by MSO Puget Sound to analyze five samples from three beaches on\\nthe Makah Reservation (Sooes Beach) and Olympic National Park (Norwegian Creek and\\nSecond Beach) to identify the types of oil and compare the results with data collected from a\\nrecent spill by the M/V An Ping No. 6 on the Columbia River.  The samples were analyzed\\nand determined to be a lightly weathered crude oil, similar to Alaska North Slope Crude.\\nThe material appeared to be enhanced with a high molecular weight wax that suggested\\ntanker cleaning or tanker sludge discharge.  All five samples fingerprinted were definitive\\nnon-matches to the M/V An Ping No. 6 reference oil.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nP 200032Z APR 94, Polrep Thirteen, Tarball Impact Makah Reservation and Olympic\\nNational Park, Minor, Unk source, MC94005131, FPN 13-4035.\\n\\nP 282228Z APR 94, COGARD MSO PUGET SOUND WA, Polrep Fourteen and Final, Tarball\\nImpact Makah Reservation and Olympic National Park, Minor, Unk source, MC94005131,\\nFPN 13-4035.\\n\\nHenry, Charles, Jr.  April 22, 1994.

A USCG boat out of Station Neah Bay confirmed the sighting before dark, describing\\nit as a silver sheen containing intermittent brown patches, 1.5 feet wide by 6 feet long, made\\nup of small tarballs described as brown, gooey clumps.  They estimated the slick covered a\\ntwo- by six-mile area.\\n\\nOn September 24, response equipment was pre-staged at Port Angeles and pre-planned\\nprotection booming as specified in the Geographical Response Plan was deployed at the\\nWaatch and Sooes rivers to protect local salmon runs.  Searches for the oil at first light by\\nCanadian and USCG vessels, spill response contractor vessels, and helicopters were\\nsignificantly hampered by heavy fog that continued throughout the day. The Vessel Traffic\\nService coordinated with all commercial vessels transiting the area for reports of any oil\\nsighting.   After not being able to find the slick, searches were discontinued at nightfall, to be\\nresumed at first light September 25.  Response equipment was left in place at Port Angeles\\nand Neah Bay.  Heavy fog prevailed throughout the next 24 hours.  When the fog finally\\nlifted, two bands of emulsified oil were sighted by an overflight late in the afternoon of\\nSeptember 26 near Point of Arches, eight miles south of Neah Bay.  However, the following\\nmorning, overflights and shoreline surveys were unable to locate any oil.  Search for the oil\\nwas suspended at 1600 on September 27 and all equipment stood down.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe NOAA trajectory analysis predicted the oil would move out of the Strait of Juan de Fuca\\nand south to an area about 6 miles southwest of the original sighting by the middle of the\\nmorning of September 24.  Without any significant winds, the slick was expected to continue\\non down the coast at the rate of around six miles per day.  The lack of any additional\\nsightings made further trajectory analysis extremely unreliable until the patches of\\nemulsified oil were observed off Point of Arches late in the afternoon of September 26.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 13\\n\\nNo recoverable oil was located.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nMedia interest triggered by the Makah tribe and local environmental groups remained high\\nthroughout the first two days and exaggerated the perceived threat.

The crew abandoned ship\\nand was rescued by another fishing vessel in the area.  The Jin Shiang Fa, a 137-foot,\\nTaiwanese-flagged fishing vessel, was carrying 10,000 gallons of diesel in its internal fuel\\ntanks, as well as an additional 100,000 gallons (2,390 barrels) of diesel in its forward cargo\\nholds when it went aground.  A USCG overflight reported the vessel hard aground on the\\nwest side of Rose Island, south of the narrow opening into the inner lagoon.  A sheen, two\\nmiles long by 200 yards wide, trailed from the vessel in a northwesterly direction away from\\nthe island.  An overflight the following day indicated that the vessel had a 30-degree list to\\nport and an 11-mile by 200-yard wide sheen trailing to the northwest.\\n\\nA charter vessel from the USCG PST, MSO Honolulu, and the USFWS arrived on-scene\\nOctober 16.  PST and MSO personnel were able to determine that there was no oil remaining\\nin the forward two fish holds, but were unable to check the remaining tanks because heavy\\nsurf washing over the vessel caused it to move around on the reef.  It was estimated that\\n40,000 gallons of diesel remained in #2 fish hold and 4,000 to 6,000 gallons in the internal\\nfuel tanks.  The charter vessel on-scene was unable to tow the Jin Shiang Fa off the reef due\\nto engine horsepower and towing cable limitations.  The fishing vessel continued to spill oil\\nfrom various sources, producing a 1-mile by 200-yard wide sheen trailing to the northwest.\\nThe charter vessel returned to American Samoa on October 19.\\n\\nThe vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s condition continued to be monitored through overflights until the owners\\ncompleted an approved salvage plan and salvage equipment arrived from Singapore on\\nNovember 28.  During this time the vessel continued to be beat by the surf and the list to\\nport increased from 30 degrees to 65 degrees.  By October 28 it was assumed that all the oil\\nin the forward fish holds had been released with only the oil in the internal aft fuel tanks\\ncontinuing to be released to produce a sheen.  Resource trustees recommended the vessel\\nstill be salvaged to minimize further mechanical damage to the coral reef.\\n\\n201\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 14\\n\\nThe USFWS coordinated a five-day, multi-agency diving and shoreline survey November 2\\nthrough 6 to assess impact of the spill and grounded vessel on the reef.  Participants in the\\nsurvey included USFWS, NOAA, American Samoan Marine Division, and a representative\\nof the responsible party.  The survey determined that the oil impact zone surrounding the\\nvessel consisted of a 400- by 600-meter area of intertidal and subtidal reef flats.  Within this\\nzone, divers estimated 75 percent mortality of giant clams; extensive coralline algae\\nbleaching; diesel entrapment in the rubble, sand, and under rocks; and oil-soaked debris on\\nthe bottom of the lagoon and seaward reef slope.  Physical impact to the reef included two\\n40-meter scars on the outer reef front and debris, including longline fishing gear, on the reef\\nfrom the intertidal zone down to 150 feet on the ocean reef front and down to 50 feet in the\\nlagoon\\n\\nThe overflight on November 26 revealed the vessel had broken in two.  The forward section\\nwith the superstructure was still on the reef flat, while the stern section had slipped off and\\nwas submerged in deeper water.  The vessel was finally salvaged at the end of November.\\nThe forward section and superstructure were towed off the reef and sunk in deep water.\\nDivers recovered the oily debris and longline gear from the lagoon and ocean-front sides of\\nthe reef slope.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nIt is estimated that 60 percent of the 110,000 gallons of diesel onboard was released within 48\\nhours of the vessel running aground, although a narrow band of sheen was observed\\ntrailing off to the northwest at varying distances from  2 to 11 miles during this period.\\nOver the next two weeks, the remaining 40,000 gallons of diesel in the forward fish holds\\nwas released as the heavy sea continued to work on the vessel.  Overflights during this\\nperiod consistently showed the sheen being carried to the west away from the lagoon.\\n\\nThe diver survey conducted the first week in November suggested that one or more of the\\nlarger releases of diesel from the forward fish holds coincided with low tide, allowing diesel\\nto pool under the coral rubble in the immediate vicinity of the vessel.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nNone of the fuel released from the vessel was recovered.  Heavy surf and the lack of a large\\nenough vessel prevented lightering or salvage of the  Jin Shiang Fa before all the fuel was\\nreleased.  Salvage of the forward section and superstructure from the surf zone and recovery\\nof oiled debris and fishing gear from the coral reef slope was successfully completed by a\\ncommercial salvage operator based in Singapore.\\n\\n202\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 14\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nThe NOAA SSC was notified by MSO Honolulu on October 14, 1993.

The vessel sank just\\nsouth of Strawberry Island in 37 fathoms of water with roughly 1,500 gallons of diesel\\nonboard.  Because the high winds made on-site assessment impossible, the National Park\\nService (NPS) conducted overflights.  The overflights showed minor sheening for several\\ndays, decreasing to nothing.

Salvage possibilities\\nwere discussed with NPS personnel, who would have liked to have the vessel removed, but\\nrecognized the risk and expense for such an operation might make removal impossible.  The\\ncase was closed on February 18.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe diesel was not catastrophically released, but trickled to the surface from air vents in the\\nfuel tanks.

NOAA notified the USCG that\\nthe most significant resources were nearby sea lion and harbor seal haulouts and a limited\\nnumber of birds.  It was believed that most resources had already sought off-water or\\nprotected water shelter from the intense winds.  NOAA advised the USCG that no response\\nwas necessary or possible.

A small-boat rescue crew from the USCG Cutter Hamilton\\nretrieved the six people onboard and reported no visible sheen in the vicinity.  A USCG\\nMSO representative was aboard the motor vessel (M/V) Mary J immediately downwind of\\nthe vessel three days after the grounding and reported no visible sheen on the water.  The\\nintense winds and heavy breakers near the vessel prevented any on-scene assessment for six\\nweeks.  However, the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner had a diving party standing by to respond if the\\nweather improved.  On April 25, the vessel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner removed the remaining fuel and in early\\nMay an attempt was made to salvage the vessel; however, when it was pulled off the rocks\\ninto deeper water it sank.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nDiesel is a non-persistent fuel and tends to disperse very rapidly.  Under the given weather\\nconditions, a catastrophic release of 12,000 gallons of diesel would have been gone in less\\nthan 10 hours.  The pounding surf and gargantuan breakers would reduce this time even\\nfurther.  Any possible environmental impact of the diesel release would have been localized\\n(less than 10 meters radius or 100 meters downwind), transient, and very difficult to visually\\nobserve and confirm.  With strong offshore winds for the duration of the incident, wildlife\\nand shorelines in the vicinity were not likely to get oiled and no shoreline impacts were\\nnoted.\\n\\n208\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 17\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nNo response was possible until April 25 when the sea and icing conditions improved\\nenough to allow salvers to board the vessel.  Approximately 6,550 gallons of fuel were\\nremoved at this time.\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nThe DOI reported that Reef Point is part of the Seal Island Historic District and is considered\\na national historic landmark.  Should any shoreside activities have been necessary, this\\nresource would have had to be considered.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on February 22, 1994, by the USCG and responded by\\nphone and fax.  The SSC kept the USCG informed of the persistence of the high wind.\\nResource agencies were contacted and it was determined that, even though at the time no\\nsignificant resources were at risk, this area served as a sea lion and fur seal rookery during\\nthe summer and, therefore, merited monitoring for actual or threatened impacts.\\n\\n209\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 17\\n\\nName of Spill:\\nNOAA SSC:\\nUSCG District:\\nDate of Spill:\\nLocation of Spill:\\nLatitude:\\nLongitude:\\nSpilled Material:\\nSpilled Material Type: \\nAmount:\\nSource of Release:\\nResources at Risk:\\nDispersants:\\nBioremediation:\\nIn-Situ Burning:\\nOther Special Interest: \\nKeywords: \\n\\nIncident Summary:\\n\\nUNOCAL Cook Inlet Baker Platform\\nJohn W.

UNOCAL immediately called their incident command team to\\nNikiski and established a command post at the Cook Inlet Spill Prevention and Response\\nInc. (CISPRI) headquarters.  CISPRI immediately launched a mechanical cleanup capability\\n(boats and skimmers) while completing the dispersant and in-situ burn (ISB) request forms.\\nNeither of these alternative response techniques were needed because the oil thinned,\\nevaporated, and dispersed too rapidly.  A total of 40 barrels were collected mechanically.\\nThe USCG and the FOSC were on-scene; however, their role was strictly one of consultation\\nand monitoring.  The response lasted about 8 hours.  Weather was warm and sunny;\\nalthough a small amount of  floating ice (<10%) was in the area.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe spilled oil was middle ground shoal crude, a very light oil with an API of 42, predicted\\nto evaporate 50 percent within the first  12 hours with no predicted dispersion.  However,\\ndue to the dynamics of Cook Inlet, less time was needed for dispersion.  Initially the oil\\nformed a slick one mile by one-third mile and moved predictably with the tidal currents.\\nUNOCAL calculated that 96 barrels were spilled and about 40 barrels were recovered; the\\nbalance is believed to have evaporated and dispersed naturally.  No significant winds were\\npresent and no areas were impacted.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nCISPRI maintains a 24-hour floating response vessel that immediately deployed boom and\\nskimmers; other vessels were immediately launched from the nearby CISPRI warehouse.\\nThe rapidity of their response is the reason they were able to achieve a 40 percent open-\\nwater recovery.  ISB and dispersants were both approved and staged but not used.\\n\\n210\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 17\\n\\nOther Special Interest Issues:\\n\\nApproval was obtained to conduct an ISB; however, the oil thinned too rapidly to be recon-\\ncentrated sufficiently to conduct the burn.  Similarly, dispersants were approved for use by\\nthe FOSC, but the oil evaporated and dispersed so rapidly that 5 or 6 hours after the release\\nthere were no slicks remaining that could be dispersed.\\n\\nInterestingly enough, after this response the Cook Inlet Regional Citizens Advisory Council\\nendorsed ISB as a primary response tool whenever there is ice present.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of this incident on April 6, 1994, by the USCG who requested on-scene\\nassistance.  The SSC notified and consulted with the resource agencies and the weather\\nservice.  Since dispersants and ISB were being considered, oil movement trajectories and oil\\nbehavior characteristics were provided to the FOSC, UNOCAL, CISPRI, and resource and\\nregulatory agencies.  On-scene, NOAA represented the FOSC on the dispersant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\neffectiveness spotter plane; however, after flying for about an hour, no oil was located.\\nNOAA supported this incident for 10 hours.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nNOAA.  1993.

Whitepass Fuel informed the MSO that the diesel was\\ncontained and cleanup was underway using sorbent materials.  Mop up continued\\nthroughout the day; only a sheen was visible by the next day.  Whitepass Fuel hired a local\\ndiver to assess any damage to the Skagway School Hatchery; no damage was reported.  The\\ncase was closed on May 24, 1994.  Weather throughout the incident was sunny with light\\nwinds from the south.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nShortly after the incident the diesel was contained around and under the pier.

The estimated quantity was 100 to 300\\ngallons extending two miles and contacting the beach;  no source was evident.  The USCG\\ncutter Liberty was diverted to the scene to utilize as a platform for beach assessment and\\npossible cleanup.  Small boats from the cutter were deployed using sorbents to mop up\\nsome of the oil.  A C-130 flight in the afternoon reported mostly small patches of weathered\\noil and sheen that was breaking up.  Samples were taken of the oil slick and of several cruise\\nships that had transited the area during the past 24 hours.  Beach contact was reported at\\nCordwood; however, a Shoreline Cleanup Advisory Team (SCAT) party organized the next\\nday, with personnel from the USCG, Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation\\n(ADEC), USFWS, U.S. Forestry Service (the land manager), Alaska Department of Natural\\nResources, and a private consultant walked the beach and reported no impacted shorelines.\\nThroughout the incident winds were from the south at 5 to 10 knots.  Samples of the oil\\nwere sent to the USCG COIL for analysis.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe oil moved north and south with the tidal currents, peaking at 0.5 knots ebb.  Even\\nthough the wind was negligible, the slick reportedly broke up and dispersed naturally in\\none day.  No shoreline was impacted.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nSorbent boom and pads were deployed by the USCG cutter Liberty and MSO personnel.\\nAdditional sorbent boom and pads were delivered to the cutter by air charger.

Apparently, a crack in one of the wing tanks\\nleaked out an estimated 200 barrels of North Slope crude and, because the normal\\ncontainment boom that surrounds loading tankers was sucked up against the hull, from 10\\nto 20 barrels of oil escaped into the Port of Valdez.   The Eastern Lion began transferring fuel\\nfrom its wing tanks to its center tanks and arranging to lighter the entire 800,000 barrels onto\\nthe waiting T/V Arco Fairbanks.  Alyeska (SERVS) response crews immediately began\\nconducting cleanup operations; however, the shorelines on Saw Island and near berths 4\\nand 5 were lightly impacted.  The small slick created by the escaping oil was largely\\ncontained in the terminal area, with significant sheens to the east and west.  Weather\\nthroughout the incident was mild with relatively calm winds.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe estimate of spilled oil was less than 200 barrels.  Sheens from the spill moved east and\\nwest with the tidal current, extending from the Soloman Gulch Salmon Hatchery on the east\\nto Anderson Bay on the west,  about 9 miles.  Sheens were also reported on the north side of\\nthe Port of Valdez near Duck Flats and the mouth of Mineral Creek.   Cleanup personnel\\nrecovered 1,366 barrels of oily liquids, containing 78 barrels of oil.  Approximately 5,700\\nbags and drums of solid waste were recovered.  Approximately 30 percent of the oil\\nevaporated just as NOAA had predicted.  The small amount of shoreline impacted near\\nberth 5 was a rocky shoreline for which no cleanup was recommended.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nAfter taking care of all the surface oil, BP instituted a formal shoreline assessment (SCAT\\nprocess) for the entire Port of Valdez.  Only light oiling near berth 5 was noted and no\\nshoreline cleanup was recommended.  BP established a wildlife center in Valdez and\\nactivated the Anchorage wildlife facility.  Although some birds, seals, and otters were\\nsighted in light sheens, none were in distress or captured.  Precautionary booming was\\nimplemented around the hatchery and in front of Duck Flats.  The USCG and the State of\\nAlaska were heavily involved in the response, which lasted three days.  USCG, State, and BP\\npersonnel remained on-scene to monitor hull cleaning operations.\\n\\n216\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 17\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident on May 22, 1994, and the SSC reported on-scene. Most of\\nthe free oil had been brought under control by the time the SSC arrived so he began\\nassessing the oiled shoreline and answering questions.  The SSC participated in the SCAT\\nprocess that involved checking the entire shoreline of the Port of Valdez, attending\\nmeetings, and ensuring that the resource agencies and other special interest groups were\\nadequately represented in the process.  As most of the manifestations of the oil were large\\nareas of sheen, considerable interest was focused on sheen toxicity.

The vessel was approximately 10 miles west of Cape\\nSarichef on the western side of Unimak Island and riding in relatively calm seas.  At the\\ntime of the fire, the vessel was carrying 126,000 gallons of diesel fuel, 7 bottles of acetylene,\\n12 bottles of oxygen, 10,000 gallons of lube oil, 8 drums of hydraulic oil, 2 drums of gasoline,\\nand 38,000 pounds of ammonia.  After the initial diesel release on July 24, additional oil\\npollution was considered a low probability as the integrity of the fuel tanks and hull were\\nnot threatened by the fire.\\n\\nThe USCG responded to what was initially a search and rescue mission.  They safely\\nrescued all but one crewmember who, unfortunately, was killed while fighting the fire.  The\\nfire caused the failure of a 10,000-gallon diesel day tank on the fore deck and the explosion,\\nrelease, and fire of most of the 38,000 pounds of ammonia.  The diesel release resulted in a\\nreported eight-mile long sheen that dissipated within 12 hours.\\n\\nTo move the vessel from the sensitive resources in Unimak Pass, a bridle was fitted to the\\nstern of the All Alaskan and she was slowly towed westward to deeper water in case\\nscuttling became necessary.  The fire subsided by July 25 but continued smoldering in the\\nforepeak holds of the vessel.  Three USCG cutters and several members of the PST went to\\nthe scene to assist.\\n\\n On July 26 the vessel was brought into Captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bay at Dutch Harbor where the fire was\\ncompletely extinguished and the vessel was thoroughly evaluated.  One bottle of ammonia\\nwas found slowly leaking after the vessel reached port; the rest were believed lost while the\\nvessel was burning at sea.  As the vessel cooled down and aired out, the response phase was\\nreplaced with a vessel integrity evaluation phase done primarily by the U.S. Navy\\nSupervisor of Salvage and representatives of the vessel.\\n\\n218\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 17\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nAn eight-mile long sheen of diesel resulted from the loss of the 10,000-gallon day tank on the\\nfore deck.  No areas were impacted, no response was attempted, and the sheen dissipated\\nand dispersed within 12 hours.\\n\\nAmmonia is flammable and was largely released and consumed in the initial conflagration.\\nWhen the initial evaluation of the All Alaskan was carried out in Captain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bay, only 3,000\\npounds of ammonia remained.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nNo response countermeasures were attempted.  As ammonia was being released in the fire\\nand the potential existed for additional oil releases, the vessel was towed westward as far\\naway from land and sensitive resources as possible.   Once the vessel was towed into\\nCaptain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bay the chemical hazards from ammonia were constantly evaluated and bottles of\\nammonia, chlorine, acetylene, and other chemicals were secured. \\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nNOAA was notified of the incident the afternoon of July 24, 1994, by the USCG and asked to\\nprovide weather and resources at risk information.  NOAA reported that the weather would\\nremain generally fair with light winds.  The SSC also reported that the incident had\\noccurred in part of a Stellar sea lion critical habitat and the islands, islets, and rookeries were\\nall part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, Aleutian Unit and included large\\nnumbers of sea birds, sea lions, and sea otters.  Two reports were prepared for the FOSC\\ndetailing the specific locations, species, and numbers of resources at risk nearby.\\n\\nInitially, there was concern that larger quantities of diesel fuel and lube oil might be\\nreleased.  NOAA, at the request of the FOSC, provided information on the possibility of\\nusing dispersants on a diesel fuel-lube oil combination.\\n\\nAfter the initial diesel release, NOAA helped answer two questions:\\n\\np What are safe distances from the ammonia releases?\\n\\np Where is a safe place to anchor the vessel for detailed assessment after the fire is\\n\\nextinguished?\\n\\nThe SSC advised the FOSC of ammonia concentrations that would pose a health risk to\\nresponders.  The USCG used other SSC-developed IDLH distances for USCG presentations\\nto the people of Dutch Harbor to familiarize them with the possible effects of an ammonia\\nrelease should it occur while the vessel was moored there.\\n\\nThe first few days after the initial fire, NOAA provided daily status reports to the resource\\nagencies and regularly interacted with them when scuttling the vessel was being considered\\nby the USCG.  The NOAA response was entirely by phone and fax and lasted\\napproximately five days.\\n\\n219\\n\\n\\x0cUSCG District 17\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nDepartment  of  Health  and  Human  Services.    1990.

The vessel had 6,000 gallons of diesel\\nfuel and 200 gallons of gasoline in drums on board.  The USCG cutter Sedge was on-scene\\nand recovered the five 55-gallon drums of gasoline and observed diesel bubbling to the\\nsurface at an estimated rate of 3 to 5 gallons per minute creating a sheen 1,300 yards by 1,600\\nyards, moving northwesterly away from the beach; it was dissipating rapidly.  The winds\\nwere light and variable throughout the incident.  Weather (low ceilings and fog) hampered\\noverflights after the initial view until the third day when overflight observers saw the sheen\\nlargely dissipated with no impact of oil on surrounding beach areas.

The grounding occurred very early August 10 and fuel tanks were immediately\\nbreached.  The barge had 20,000 gallons of diesel onboard.  The weather continued to\\ndeteriorate as winds increased to 30 to 40 knots, with high seas and heavy breakers\\npounding the barge and Cape Nome.  The owner believes that most of the 20,000 gallons\\nwas lost during the first 12 hours.  The responsible party was very cooperative with the\\nUSCG and was very proactive in attempts to salvage the barge.  The continuation of high\\nwinds, however, caused further deterioration and damage to the barge, so it was towed\\noffshore and scuttled.  The owner saved a large crane onboard and used temporary patches\\nto ensure the barge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flotation en route to the scuttle area.  Heavy weather persisted as the\\nbarge was towed offshore.   Finally, in 135 feet of water, explosive charges were detonated\\nand the barge was sunk at 64\\xc2\\xb028.37\\xe2\\x80\\x99, 169\\xc2\\xb025.14\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  This response lasted 16 days.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nCape Nome is a very exposed wave-cut platform, rocky headland and the high winds that\\ndrove the diesel onto the rocks quickly caused the oil to disperse and dissipate.  No diesel\\nwas recovered and no areas were apparently impacted.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nHigh winds made countermeasures impossible.\\n\\nNOAA Activities:\\n\\nThe USCG and NOAA were notified of the incident the morning of August 10, 1994.\\nNOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response was entirely by phone and fax.

The spill  occurred when\\noil flowed up through the No. 1 port expansion trunk and sounding tube saturating the\\nbarge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wooden deck.  The response was initiated by Forty-Niner Transportation, the\\nresponsible party; but Verca, a local spill contractor, was hired to complete the response.\\nThe oil moved under the dock and out the north end in response to a back eddy from the\\nebbing tide.  Containment boom and sorbents were deployed around the barge and at the\\nnorth end of the dock.  Sheen extended north along the shore 50 to 100 yards offshore from\\nnear the dock to the vicinity of Cairn Point.  Overflight observers reported isolated ribbons\\nand stringers of sheen with no more than 50 gallons of diesel estimated to be on the water\\nnear Cairn Point and no wildlife activity on shore within four miles.  Much of the diesel\\ndispersed naturally in the energetic currents of Cook Inlet; however, the next morning MSO\\nrepresentatives noted approximately five small sheens in the dock area and judged that\\nfurther cleanup was possible.  Approximately 100 to 110 gallons of oil-water mix were\\nrecovered.  The weather throughout the incident was light winds from the southwest and\\ngood visibility.\\n\\nBehavior of Oil:\\n\\nThe sheen moved north along the coast during an ebb tide, apparently in response to a back\\neddy.  Of the 400 to 500 gallons of diesel spilled, only 110 gallons of oil-water mix were\\nrecovered.  No areas were impacted.\\n\\nCountermeasures and Mitigation:\\n\\nContainment and sorbent booms were deployed around the barge.

At 0525, the tug reported the incident to the USCG and by 0600 a USCG 41-@foot patrol boat was onscene and reported an oil sheen on the water.  The barge's #1@starboard tank had been holed and approximately 22,000 gallons of #2 diesel was in the@water.  The starboard hold contained 39,000 gallons; the barge carried about 1 million@gallons.@@\",\n",
       " \"USCG District 1@@Overflight personnel reported a two and one-half mile sheen extending to the east.  A later@overflight revealed that most of the sheen had moved back to the west.  Protective booming@was in place at Baker Cove and the Poquonock River.@@The barge came off the rock and was anchored to await further lightering.  A diver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survey@revealed that the grounding had caused a 3- by 10-foot hole in the #1 starboard tank and@three 30-foot fractures.  The remaining oil was lightered before the barge was moved to New@York for repairs.@@Behavior of Spilled Material:@@The release of about 22,000 gallons of diesel fuel from Barge RTC 380 resulted in the spread@of sheen ranging in appearance from rainbow colors to silver to gray over the area from the@eastern shore of Fisher Island to the Connecticut River.  Most of the shoreline directly@impacted by the sheen was composed of rocky shores, manmade structures, and sand@beaches.  Sheens were observed in very few wetland areas.  The spilled diesel persisted as@sheen on the water's surface for three days because of the cold temperatures and light winds@that slowed evaporation and dispersion.@@Diesel is acutely toxic to animals living in the intertidal zone, but minimal long-term@impacts to natural resources are expected from this incident.  Studies of the World Prodigy@spill at the mouth of Narragansett Bay in 1989 show that when heavy slicks come ashore,@intertidal animals are killed, but algae survive and only short-term impacts to algae@reproduction occur.  Significant shoreline contamination did not take place during this@incident.@@Countermeasures and Mitigation:@@The barge was boomed by the USCG by 0715, refloated at 1400, and totally offloaded by@0430 on December 22.  The responsible party hired Clean Harbors to perform cleanup@activities.

It was decided that two state DEP responders would start the burn, each@wearing fire-retarding turnout gear.@@The media was informed and the story of the upcoming in-situ burn was broadcast so the@population would not become alarmed if a large dark cloud appeared.@@The burn began late morning on April 6, 1993.  The state DEP representatives used sorbent@pads soaked in JP-5 to light the marsh.  The floating fuel ignited easier than was expected@and burned remarkably well.  The initial burn lasted almost two hours without needing to@be re-ignited.  The smoke was seen in Portland, 30 miles south and Augusta, 40 miles north,@and was recorded by NASB aircraft to be between 2,000 and 6,000 feet high.  The burn was@videotaped from a fixed-wing, single-engine USN aircraft by the U.S. Environmental@Protection Agency (EPA).@@During the first day of burning, EPA technical assistance teams conducted air monitoring in@the area.  They sampled for volatile organic compounds and particulate (PM-10).@@As the initial burn began to subside, additional pools of JP-5 were ignited.  The marsh was@burned in various locations for eight hours.  The cattail stalks that remained in the marsh@acted as wicks in some areas, pulling the fuel from under the ice.@@Responders continued the burn on April 7 in the ice of the Androscoggin River.  Channels@and openings were cut to allow fuel to seep in and a sorbent pad was used as a wicking@agent.  Responders returned the following day and burned the marsh for an additional four@hours.  These fires were considerably smaller than earlier ones, but continued to remove@fuel.

At 0525, the tug reported the incident to the USCG and by 0600 a USCG 41-@foot patrol boat was onscene and reported an oil sheen on the water.  The barge's #1@starboard tank had been holed and approximately 22,000 gallons of #2 diesel was in the@water.  The starboard hold contained 39,000 gallons; the barge carried about 1 million@gallons.@@\",\n",
       " \"USCG District 1@@Overflight personnel reported a two and one-half mile sheen extending to the east.  A later@overflight revealed that most of the sheen had moved back to the west.  Protective booming@was in place at Baker Cove and the Poquonock River.@@The barge came off the rock and was anchored to await further lightering.  A diver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s survey@revealed that the grounding had caused a 3- by 10-foot hole in the #1 starboard tank and@three 30-foot fractures.  The remaining oil was lightered before the barge was moved to New@York for repairs.@@Behavior of Spilled Material:@@The release of about 22,000 gallons of diesel fuel from Barge RTC 380 resulted in the spread@of sheen ranging in appearance from rainbow colors to silver to gray over the area from the@eastern shore of Fisher Island to the Connecticut River.  Most of the shoreline directly@impacted by the sheen was composed of rocky shores, manmade structures, and sand@beaches.  Sheens were observed in very few wetland areas.  The spilled diesel persisted as@sheen on the water's surface for three days because of the cold temperatures and light winds@that slowed evaporation and dispersion.@@Diesel is acutely toxic to animals living in the intertidal zone, but minimal long-term@impacts to natural resources are expected from this incident.  Studies of the World Prodigy@spill at the mouth of Narragansett Bay in 1989 show that when heavy slicks come ashore,@intertidal animals are killed, but algae survive and only short-term impacts to algae@reproduction occur.  Significant shoreline contamination did not take place during this@incident.@@Countermeasures and Mitigation:@@The barge was boomed by the USCG by 0715, refloated at 1400, and totally offloaded by@0430 on December 22.  The responsible party hired Clean Harbors to perform cleanup@activities.  Sorbent booms were deployed in areas of oil concentration in Niantic Harbor.@Exclusionary boom was deployed in the Bushy Point area to ensure oil did not reach the@marshes.  Shoreline Assessment Teams consisting of USCG, responsible party and State@representatives walked impacted areas and documented oiling.@@Other Special Interests:@@The Shoreline Survey Evaluation Form from NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Shoreline Countermeasures Manual  for@Temperate Coastal Areas was used successfully during the shoreline assessment to document@impacted areas.  Suggestions for improvements to the form were made.@@Connecticut shellfish areas were closed until they could be tested by the State Department of@Agriculture.  Tri-State Bird Rescue and Rehabilitation were on standby in the event that@large numbers of oiled birds were encountered.  Only four dead and about a dozen oiled@birds were found.@@Detectable oil vapors were reported on Fishers Island; however, no additional precautions@were recommended because the vapors did not threaten human health.@@The media was very interested in the spill the first day.  The SSC participated in one press@meeting and was interviewed several times.@@NOAA Activities:@@6@@\\x0cUSCG District 1@@NOAA was notified of this incident at 0915 on December 21, 1992, and reported onscene at@1300 after receiving an initial briefing by telephone.  The SSC provided trajectory@assessments, tide information, and daily weather forecasts.  The SSC advised that priority@protection should be given to areas of restricted flow and low energy if the oil moves@toward them.

It was decided that two state DEP responders would start the burn, each@wearing fire-retarding turnout gear.@@The media was informed and the story of the upcoming in-situ burn was broadcast so the@population would not become alarmed if a large dark cloud appeared.@@The burn began late morning on April 6, 1993.

The initial burn lasted almost two hours without needing to@be re-ignited.  The smoke was seen in Portland, 30 miles south and Augusta, 40 miles north,@and was recorded by NASB aircraft to be between 2,000 and 6,000 feet high.  The burn was@videotaped from a fixed-wing, single-engine USN aircraft by the U.S. Environmental@Protection Agency (EPA).@@During the first day of burning, EPA technical assistance teams conducted air monitoring in@the area.  They sampled for volatile organic compounds and particulate (PM-10).@@As the initial burn began to subside, additional pools of JP-5 were ignited.  The marsh was@burned in various locations for eight hours.  The cattail stalks that remained in the marsh@acted as wicks in some areas, pulling the fuel from under the ice.@@Responders continued the burn on April 7 in the ice of the Androscoggin River.  Channels@and openings were cut to allow fuel to seep in and a sorbent pad was used as a wicking@agent.  Responders returned the following day and burned the marsh for an additional four@hours.

The North Carolina State@requirement that all water pumped from any recovery well must receive extensive water@treatment would have required installation and maintenance of an expensive water@treatment system.  Consequently, a passive recovery system was designed and@implemented.  The passive recovery system consists of a trench and impervious barrier that@runs parallel to the canal to prevent further discharge of product into the water.  Since the@width of the plume at the discharge point was relatively narrow, oil would temporarily@accumulate against the barrier for recovery.  A series of perforated 55-gallon drums was@placed in the trench to provide a large surface area for recovering the oil.  Sorbents were@placed in the drums and periodically replaced when no longer effective.  This method was a@low-cost alternative to an active recovery system and stopped the discharge of oil into the@canal.@@Special Interest Issues:@@Although this incident may be best characterized as a remediation project, the USCG took@responsibility for cleanup of the site because of the discharge to U.S. waters.

NOAA told MSO that diesel was highly volatile and@would not remain a cohesive slick for very long because of the strong on-scene winds.  The@slick should not last more than 6 to 12 hours.  A localized fish kill near the site of the@grounding might occur, but a significant threat to the Florida Keys did not exist because of@the small amount of product and the stormy weather.

Some of the issues raised were:@@Should an attempt to refloat the vessel with fuel and cargo onboard be made or@should they be removed before salvage operations?   Because the vessel had@structural damage it was decided to  remove the fuel and cargo to lighten her before@salvage operations began.@@Was the ship structurally sound and could she hold together during reef removal@operations?   Initially, the OSC was told that the ship probably would not stay intact,@and based on this advice decided to remove the diesel fuel-lube oil and clean the@residual product from the vessel and leave the vessel on the reef (it would then be@NOAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responsibility to salvage the vessel).  NOAA  expressed a real concern with@this plan because the  residual diesel fuel-lube oil still presented a substantial@pollution threat and felt that all removal options should be explored before leaving@the vessel grounded on the reef.  NAVSUPSALV believed the vessel could be@salvaged (refloated) intact, and after some discussion, the OSC decided to attempt to@refloat the vessel.@@Was the  contractor aware of the sensitivity of the reef and would all precautions be@taken to minimize any additional damage to the reef?

Because@the soil was composed of dense, highly compacted clay, penetration into the ground was not@very deep; about six inches in the worst areas.  No impacts were observed farther down-@stream, in the freshwater marsh, or in the mangroves, but sheens were observed in a small@pond near the coast.@@Countermeasures and Mitigation:@@Heavy rains flushed the area, but the contractor released a 3,000-gallon tank of water to@flush it further.  Digging an interruption trench to contain remaining diesel draining into the@creek was considered, but the absence of new sheens in the water indicated that it was not@necessary.  Removing contaminated soil at the spill site and replacing it with new soil or@remediating it in a separate area before returning it to its origin was also considered.  The@contaminated soil was left in place because enhanced erosion was feared and the total@petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) values obtained from the soil samples were high.  To@enhance natural biodegradation, in-situ aeration of soil to enhance natural biodegradation of@the hydrocarbons was begun.  A monitoring plan was established, including taking monthly@soil samples to observe degradation of the hydrocarbons and frequently looking for@additional sheening to assess the need for continued use of absorbent materials.  When TPH@values decline and vegetation begins to grow on the impacted areas, the soil will be@fertilized and replanted with grass.  It is expected that the monitoring plan will continue for@six months, at which time the effectiveness of the mitigation can be gauged and more@extensive soil sample analyses can be run.@@Other Special Interest Issues:@@Some residents needed medical attention after being exposed to the strong diesel vapors;@none of the responders suffered any medical problems.@@NOAA Activities:@@NOAA was notified of the incident on June 16, 1993, by the USCG MSO San Juan, and@requested to report onscene June 20.

MSO Tampa closed the port to vessel@traffic.  This collision caused three separate emergencies:  1) the Balsa 37,  which was@carrying a cargo of phosphate rock, was severely damaged on the starboard side, was listing@at an increasing rate, and was in danger of capsizing in the channel; 2) the Ocean 255, which@was loaded with jet fuel, gasoline, and a small amount of diesel fuel, was burning out of@control just south of Mullet Key; and 3) the Bouchard 155  was holed at the port bow, spilling@approximately 8,000 barrels of #6 fuel oil into Tampa Bay.@@Stabilizing the vessels was the first priority of responders.

The Balsa 37 was intentionally grounded outside the shipping channel to prevent it@from capsizing and to open the channel for traffic while repairs and stability evaluations@were conducted.@@August 10 overflight observations showed a three- to six-meter wide band of oil along the@beaches.  By the next day, this band appeared to be about half its original width.  Systematic@shoreline surveys were conducted and oil was found buried by two to eight inches of clean@sand deposited during high tide.  Cleanup crews focused on manually removing the band of@surface oil high on the beach.  A plan was developed to remove the subsurface oil without@generating large volumes of sediment for handling, disposal, and replacement.  The plan@called for mechanical removal of the heavy buried layers, manual removal of moderately@oiled sediments, and mechanically pushing stained sand onto the lower part of the beach for@surf washing.  Pompoms were strung along the surf zone to collect any oil refloated during@the surf washing.@@By August 11 the status of the vessels had improved substantially.  The response focus@began to change from  emergency issues to skimming operations, protection strategies,@forecasts, and planning.@@Meanwhile, cleanup crews were contending with very thick oil that had been deposited@around some mangrove islands.  Tarmats formed when sediment was mixed with oil along@the shallow flats surrounding the islands.  Large thick mats coated mangrove roots, oyster@and seagrass beds, and tidal mud flats.  Most of this oil was vacuumed out using vacuum@transfer units on grounded barges staged around the islands and shallow areas.  Seawalls@within the bay were being washed using high-pressure water heated to 110 degrees.@@The GST was onscene throughout the spill response.  They provided support with the@Vessel of Opportunity Skimming System as well as the fire fighting, monitoring, and@lightering of the Ocean 255 barge.@@Roughly 14.5 miles of fine-grained sand beach from St. Petersburg Beach north to Redington@Shores Beach were affected by this spill.  Sand beaches on Egmont Key at the entrance to@Tampa Bay were also oiled.  Additionally, four mangrove islands inside the entrance to Boca@Ciega Bay at Johns Pass and two small areas of Spartina marsh were oiled.  Jetties, seawalls,@and riprap within the bay and at Johns Pass and Blind Pass were also oiled to varying@degrees.  It is estimated that over 30 miles of residential seawalls were oiled within Boca@Ciega Bay.  Some impact also occurred on the northern side of Mullet Key at Bonne Fortune@Key in fringing mangroves.@@Seawalls, jetties, walkways, and riprap were cleaned by high-pressure, hot-water washes.@The shoreline cleaner PES-51 was considered for some of these cleaning needs, but after@observing comparison tests performed by the manufacturer, the responsible party decided@against its use.@@NOAA  worked with the  RRT, the GST, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the FOSC, state@officials, and various scientists and engineers to develop a sound method to deal with the@tarmats.  As of December 1993, debris from the incident was being washed ashore and@cleanup of submerged tarmats offshore was ongoing.@@Behavior of Spilled Material:@@The #6 fuel oil from the Bouchard 155 barge is the only material known to have been released@during this incident.  The oil initially formed a contiguous slick that moved west out of@Tampa Bay.  Once out of the bay, the oil moved west and north into the Gulf of Mexico@@69@@\\x0cUSCG District 7@@where it began to break up into more widely scattered fields and tarballs with some heavy@concentrated bands.  The winds were predominantly easterly initially but began to shift to@westerly by August 12, driving the oil closer to shore.  By August 14 shoreline oiling,@reported as light tarballs, was occurring from southern St. Petersburg Beach north to@Madeira Beach.  By August 15 most of the floating oil had come ashore and heavily coated@sand beaches, several mangrove islands, and seawalls within Boca Ciega Bay.  By August 16@very little floating oil was seen offshore.@@In the shallow, low-energy areas along the mangrove islands inside Johns Pass and at a few@locations in the surf zone, a small fraction of the total spill mixed with beach sand and@shallow sediments to form underwater tarmats.  These mats were described as having the@consistency of frosting or peanut butter with an outer skin that held the mat together.  The@mats within the bay area tended to fall apart once this skin was ruptured, but the mats@offshore maintained their cohesiveness.@@Several tarmats were located offshore in 6 to 20 feet of water.  They averaged 20 by 150 feet@and were about 2 inches thick.  This oil was expected to weather very slowly with the mats@probably remaining in place.  Two of the mats were perpendicular to the shoreline in@dredged borrow areas dating to 1985.  The area is to be mapped to locate any additional@tarmats.  The FOSC issued an administrative order to the responsible party directing them@to remove the submerged oil.  Procedures for this operation were developed and approved.@Remote sensors were used to find the submerged tarmats and divers manually removed@them.@@Countermeasures and Mitigation:@@Both mechanical and manual countermeasures were used during this spill.  Skimming@operations were used to collect free-floating oil.   Efficiency and effectiveness of skimming@operations were extremely high.  The oil-to-water ratio of retrieved product was estimated@to be as high as 90 percent in many cases.  A major limitation  to skimming operations@developed when much of the product was dispersed into widely scattered tarball fields and@was essentially unavailable for retrieval.  Skimming was effective until the oil came ashore.@@Due to a southerly nearshore surface countercurrent, it was thought that transport of oil@refloated during tidal cycles or surf washing might impact  sensitive areas south of St.@Petersburg Beach.  Boom was deployed and maintained as a protective measure for these@areas.@@Once the oil beached, cleanup consisted of manual removal of the surface oil, mechanical@removal of subsurface oil, and surf washing of stained sand.  Removing sand and washing@surf was done by using heavy equipment such as front-end loaders and graders.  Cleanup@techniques for removing buried oil were developed, tested, and monitored by a Shoreline@Cleanup Technical Committee, with members from NOAA, the responsible party, the State@of Florida, and the underwriter.  Final grooming of the beaches was accomplished with@graders and disking, normally to a depth of 12 inches.  Care was taken not to disturb nesting@sea turtles throughout the cleanup operations.  All beaches were surveyed and inspected by@a Shoreline \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow Clean Is Clean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Committee consisting of representatives of the@responsible party, USCG, NOAA, and officials from local and state agencies.  The criteria@used to judge beach cleanliness were visual observations and touch and smell analysis.  To@pass inspection, beaches had to look clean and the sand could not feel oily or have an oily@odor.  More elaborate sampling and laboratory analysis techniques were considered but@would be very expensive and unnecessary. All oiled sand was disposed of in an approved@non-hazardous landfill.@@70@@\\x0cUSCG District 7@@Oil in and around mangrove islands was removed by vacuuming.  Areas were left oiled@when it was felt that cleanup methods would cause greater impact than leaving the oil in@place.  Some of the submerged oil in very shallow areas was removed using buckets and@shovels.  Seagrass beds that received oiling were cleaned by gently lifting oil out of them by@hand.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow clean is clean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d inspections for mangroves, seagrass beds, and other sensitive@areas would be judged on a case-by case-basis by the inspection committee.  When the@responsible party felt a particular area had been cleaned satisfactorily under the guidelines@set by the Shoreline Cleanup Technical Committee , an inspection determined whether the@area was in fact clean.@@Other Special Interest Issues:@@During the cleanup operations, a test demonstration of PES-51 for cleaning jetties, riprap,@concrete walkways, and metal hand railings at the entrance to Johns Pass was conducted.@PES-51 washes were performed twice.  The effectiveness was compared to results from the@high-pressure, hot-water washes being used to clean the seawalls within the bay.  The water@washes generally did a better job on the rocks and rough surfaces, whereas the PES-51@seemed to have a slight advantage on the smoother surfaces.  After observing the tests, the@RRT granted approval for the use of PES-51 on jetties, concrete and wooden walkways, and@hand railings as needed.  NOAA recommended using the water washes and then, if needed,@use  PES-51 to further clean the more heavily oiled and persistent areas.  The responsible@party chose not to use PES-51 for any of the cleaning.@@The Ocean 255 fire was a health and safety risk. The smoke plume presented a hazard as did@the potential for explosions and burns.  After the fire was out, and during subsequent@lightering operations, the possibility of flashbacks or explosions still existed.@@Heat stress became a problem for many of the responders and cleanup crews.@@The potential health risks to swimmers and users of oil-contaminated public beaches@became an issue.  The oil spilled has a high aromatic fraction and high levels of sulfur.  The@viability of using public beaches while heavy equipment was in operation was also@considered.@@Local weather was watched closely throughout the spill response.  Tropical storms or@localized thunderstorms could be a detriment to the response.  One responder was struck by@lightning.@@Representatives from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) were@brought onscene to address these issues and to monitor proper worker safety.  NOAA, the@USCG, and OSHA worked together closely while addressing these issues.@@The cooperation among all the parties involved in this response was exceptional.  Local@officials were supportive throughout the response and provided meaningful input to the@process.  The State of Florida assumed the role of lead trustee and did an excellent job of@coordinating efforts for the response, while at the same time performing damage assessment@duties.  It was officially noted that the success of wildlife and bird rescue and treatment@operations were unprecedented.

Moderate levels of oil were found in the riprap under the@west end of Blair Pier and a barge slip located on the south shore of the waterway west of@the Pierce County Terminal.  A thin-coated narrow band of black oil was found@intermittently along the rest of the shoreline out to the entrance to Blair Waterway.@@The Blair Waterway is one of five industrial waterways on the east side of Commencement@Bay dredged and filled from wetlands at the mouth of the Puyallup River.  The shoreline at@the east end of the waterway where the spill occurred was characterized by a thick clay@layer overlain with intermittent pockets of sand and gravel.  The steeper backshore of the@beach was stabilized with loose boulders and cobbles.  Oil was deposited as a thick coating@along approximately two miles of the shoreline in the early stages of the spill.  Successive@high tides tended to refloat the oil off the clay and sand areas, while the oil adhered loosely@to the rough surfaces of the algae, rocks, gravel, and clumps of mussels and barnacles lying@on top of the clay.@@Countermeasures and Mitigation:@@Significant pockets of black oil were trapped and contained by booms at the Pierce County@Pier, Weyerhaeuser Dock, and Blair Waterway.  Skimmers were used to recover the oil from@these pockets.  Deflection booms deployed along the northeast shore of Blair Waterway@were used to recover oil refloated off the beaches by the high tide carried  by the ebb current@toward the waterway entrance.  Oil was recovered from these booms after each ebb tide by@skimmers or manually picked up from small workboats using sorbent pads and pompoms.@@High-volume, low-pressure flushing was particularly successful in mobilizing black oil@pooled in rocks and gravel in the mid- to upper-tidal level of the beach down to the water@where it could be collected.  Oil was flushed into a boom close to the water\\xe2\\x80\\x99s edge and then@recovered manually using sorbent pads and pompoms.  Flushing operations were restricted@to mid- to high tide to ensure adequate water protected the clean lower intertidal area from@contamination by oil flushed out of the rocks.  Active flushing was discontinued after about@ten days when the volumes of oil recovered decreased and the proper tide window no@longer occurred during daylight hours.@@A limited amount of high-pressure flushing was used on some of the more heavily@contaminated pilings at Pierce County Terminal and Weyerhaeuser Dock.  The water@pressure was maintained at a level just below the point where it knocked mussels and@barnacles off to prevent moving contaminated organisms into the food chain.  Hand-@scraping a thick band of oil along a steep clay bank above the high-tide line in the barge slip@was also tried to prevent the oil from being remobilized during the next spring tide.  Tilling@and turning over of small cobble armoring of sand and gravel in a heavily impacted area@just west of Weyerhaeuser was done to release relatively unweathered oil from underneath@the rocks and speed up natural flushing of the area.@@Other Special Interest Issues:@@One of the shorelines more heavily contaminated in this spill included an old graving dock located@just west of the Weyerhaeuser Dock.

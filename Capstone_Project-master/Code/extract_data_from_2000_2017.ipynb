       "'2000 On August 19, a 30-inch diameter [[El Paso Natural Gas]] pipeline rupture and fire near [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]] killed 12 members of an extended family camping over {{convert|600|ft|m}} from the rupture point. The force of the escaping gas created a {{convert|51|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide crater about {{convert|113|ft|m}} along the pipe. A {{convert|49|ft|m|adj=on}} section of the pipe was ejected from the crater, in three pieces measuring approximately {{convert|3|ft|m}}, {{convert|20|ft|m}}, and {{convert|26|ft|m}} in length. The largest piece of pipe was found about {{convert|287|ft|m}} northwest of the crater. The cause of the failure was determined to be severe internal corrosion of that pipeline. On July 26, 2007, a USDOJ Consent Decree was later entered into by the pipeline owner to perform pipeline system upgrades to allow better internal pipeline inspections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0301.aspx |title=Pipeline Accident Report PAR-03-01 |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date=August 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908011132/http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0301.aspx |archivedate=September 8, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/4431.htm |title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : U.S. v.

       "'2007 On November 12, three teenaged boys drilled into an ammonia pipeline, in [[Tampa Bay, Florida]], causing a major ammonia leak. They later claimed they did it due to stories of money being hidden inside that pipeline. The leak took two days to be capped. One of the teens had serious chemical burns from the ammonia. Residents within a half miles from the leak were evacuated. PHMSA later noted the pipeline company failed to adequately plan for emergencies with the local Fire Agency, as required by CFR 195.402(c)(12).<ref>{{cite web|title=CPF No. 2-2008-6002 |url=http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220086002/220086002_FinalOrder_04262010.pdf |accessdate=27 November 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211114341/https://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/220086002/220086002_FinalOrder_04262010.pdf |archivedate=February 11, 2017 }}</ref>'"

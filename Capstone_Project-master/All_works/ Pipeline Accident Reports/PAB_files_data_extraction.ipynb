At about the same time, a valve was opened at the\\nother end of that line to allow the product to flow into the East Knoxville facility tanks. At\\nthe completion of the delivery, the valves were closed, which left the pipeline filled with\\ndiesel fuel at a pressure of about 91 psig. \\n\\nAbout  11:58  p.m.  on  February  9,  the  supervisory  control  and  data  acquisition\\n(SCADA) system2 at Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Atlanta control center registered and recorded a sudden\\ndrop in pressure from 91 to 72 psig at East Knoxville. After several minutes of oscillation,\\nthe pressure stabilized at 73 to 74 psig. The controller on duty in the Atlanta control center\\nat  the  time  of  the  accident  stated  that  he  normally  displays  the  SCADA  pressure  strip\\ncharts3  across  the  two  CRT  screens  at  the  top  of  his  operating  console.  The  SCADA\\n\\n1 A  Colonial  stubline  is  a  smaller  diameter,  lateral  pipeline  system  that  emanates  from  one  of  the\\n\\ncompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s larger mainline pipelines that run from Texas to New York.\\n\\n2 Pipeline controllers use the SCADA system to remotely control and monitor movement of product\\nthrough the pipeline. Controllers can monitor flow rates and pressures along the lines and control valves and\\npipeline pumps to adjust the flow and make product deliveries.\\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c\\x0f\\n\\nsystem did not alarm in response to the decrease in pressure, and the controller said he was\\nnot aware of the pressure drop. As determined later, the pressure drop occurred when the\\npipeline  leading  to  East  Knoxville  ruptured  on  a  Pitner  Place  residential  property  near\\nKnoxville\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Goose Creek.\\n\\nOn the east side of the Tennessee River, Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pipeline crosses Scottish Pike\\nand then Pitner Place. Between midnight and 12:15 a.m. on February 10, a Scottish Pike\\nresident walking outside his home smelled a kerosene odor, but he said he took no action\\nin regard to the smell. At 1:02 a.m. on February 10, a resident of Pitner Place called 911 to\\nreport a very strong diesel or gasoline odor in the area. The Knoxville Fire Department\\nresponded and concluded that the reported odors came from an asphalt plant across the\\nriver from the community. Thus believing this odor did not pose any further concern but\\nwas merely a nuisance odor, the firefighters cancelled the fire call and left the scene.\\n\\nAbout 2:05 a.m., another Pitner Place resident closer to the pipe rupture, called 911\\nto report a very strong petroleum gas odor in the area. The fire department returned to the\\nscene  to  investigate.  Again,  the  fire  company  attributed  the  odor  to  the  nearby  asphalt\\nplant. At  2:17 a.m.,  a Knoxville  area  resident  called 911  to  report  oil on  the  Tennessee\\nRiver.\\n\\nMeanwhile,  the  Atlanta  controller  (still  unaware  of  the  drop  in  the  pipeline\\npressure) called the Knoxville operator to start another product delivery to East Knoxville.\\nAbout  2:31  a.m.,  the  Knoxville  operator  began  operating  valves  to  send  product  to  the\\nEast Knoxville delivery facility. The Atlanta controller observed that the East Knoxville\\nmeter indicated no flow rate and that the pressure did not rise as expected at Knoxville.\\nThe Knoxville operator said that after waiting 4 to 5 minutes for the flow rate to register\\non  his  CRT  screen,  he  called  the  Atlanta  controller  about  the  situation.  The  Atlanta\\ncontroller  called  the  senior  controller  for  his  shift  over  to  the  console  to  discuss  the\\npipeline data, at which point the senior controller decided to terminate the delivery on the\\nEast Knoxville line. About 2:39 a.m., the Knoxville operator began shutting down the East\\nKnoxville pipeline section and resumed using the stubline to make a delivery to another\\nKnoxville terminal. \\n\\nAfter  shutting  down  the  line,  about  2:44  a.m.,  the  Knoxville  operator  called\\nanother  Colonial  employee  at  home  and  asked  him  to  check  out  the  East  Knoxville\\ndelivery  facility.  In  a  discussion  with  the  Knoxville  operator  at  3:01  a.m.,  the  Atlanta\\ncontroller suggested that the pipeline might have been in a slack condition (only partially\\nfilled  with  product)  when  the  delivery  started,  but  he  added  that  the  pipeline  pressure\\nshould have increased faster at that time. In that discussion, he also said that the pipeline\\nwas 600 to 700 barrels short. \\n\\nThe hourly over/short calculation shown on the controller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s log for the line showed\\na  shortage  of  725  barrels at  3:00  a.m.  After  the  accident,  the  Atlanta  controller  said  he\\nconsidered the shortage \\xe2\\x80\\x9chigh.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He also said that 300 barrels is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgetting high,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d although he\\nbelieved  that  300  barrels  could  be  explained  as  a  characteristic  of  the  opening  of  a\\ndelivery. According to Colonial procedures, a sudden loss of pressure and/or a change in\\n\\n3 The SCADA system provides pressure data on a strip chart graphical display on a CRT screen, which\\n\\ndisplays the pressure history for about the previous hour.\\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c\\x10\\n\\nflow rate are to be interpreted as conclusive evidence of a leak. As part of Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leak\\ndetection  strategy,  controllers  are  to  immediately  investigate  and  correct  any  shortage\\ncalculation. \\n\\nAt 3:45 a.m., Knoxville Fire Department responders found fuel running into Goose\\nCreek, which discharges into the Tennessee River about 1/2 mile downstream. Noting a\\nnearby  Colonial  pipeline  marker  with  contact  information,  the  incident  commander\\ndirected  a  Knoxville  Fire  Department  dispatcher  trainee  to  contact  Colonial  about  the\\nleak; however, Colonial was not notified at that time.\\n\\nMeanwhile,  the  Colonial  employee  who  had  been  asked  to  check  the  East\\nKnoxville  facility  had  driven  by  the  site  where  an  internal  inspection  tool  had  been\\nremoved from the pipeline on February 9 (discussed below in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPipeline Information\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nsection). About 4:00 a.m., he reported that he saw no evidence of a failure in the pipeline\\nat that location, nor did he find any problem at the East Knoxville facility.\\n\\nStill unaware of the nature of the problem, the Knoxville operator and the called-\\nout Colonial employee discussed the situation with the Atlanta controller. At the end of the\\ndiscussion,  the  Atlanta  controller  decided  that  the  Knoxville  operator  should  attempt\\nanother delivery to East Knoxville. The senior controller was not involved in the decision\\nto  restart  delivery.  This  time,  the  called-out  operator  would  be  observing  at  East\\nKnoxville.  About  4:03  a.m.,  the  operator  attempted  to  pressure  up  the  line  between\\nKnoxville and East Knoxville, but the pressure did not rise as expected. About 4:20 a.m.,\\nhe again opened the East Knoxville valve to operate this pipeline section, and initially no\\nflow was noted at East Knoxville. After a few minutes, the pressure began to fluctuate and\\na lower-than-expected flow rate was indicated. The hourly flow rate was expected to be\\nmore than 3,000 barrels per hour (bph); however, it peaked at approximately 2,000 bph.\\n\\nAbout 4:30 a.m., the Knoxville Fire Department found diesel fuel spraying from a\\npipeline onto a Pitner Place residence and running downhill into Goose Creek, which was\\nabout 170 feet from the rupture site. The incident commander asked the fire department\\ncommunications center dispatcher to contact Colonial and have the company shut down\\nthe  pipeline.  The  fire  department  dispatcher,  who  was  talking  to  Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  senior\\ncontroller in Atlanta at that time, notified him of the leak and asked that the pipeline be\\nshut down. The senior controller immediately ordered that the Knoxville stubline be shut\\ndown. The East Knoxville segment shutdown was completed at 4:35 a.m. At 4:46 a.m.,\\nthe East Knoxville delivery valve was opened, and the pipeline segment was then allowed\\nto drain into the East Knoxville terminal. According to Colonial records, the temperature\\nof the product was approximately 61\\xc2\\xb0 F at East Knoxville.\\n\\nThe  ruptured  pipeline  released  approximately  53,550  gallons  (1,275  barrels)  of\\ndiesel fuel. Fifteen people were reported to have voluntarily evacuated the immediate area\\nof the leak. During the first 24 hours, the leading edge of the oil slick on the Tennessee\\nRiver advanced about 6 miles downstream from Goose Creek. For the next several days,\\nthe Tennessee River in the Knoxville area was closed to navigation as containment booms\\nwere placed downriver. Nine collection points for escaped petroleum product were placed\\ndownstream of the accident site. Colonial estimated that 44,016 gallons (1,048 barrels) of\\nproduct have been recovered. No fire resulted, and no injuries were reported.\\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c\\x11\\n\\nOn March 3, 1999, Colonial submitted a Corrective Action Plan for Impacted Soils\\nand Groundwater at the Goose Creek Knoxville, Tennessee, Release Site to the Tennessee\\nDivision of Solid Waste Management and Tennessee Division of Water Pollution Control.\\nThe intent of the action plan was to determine the extent of the underground diesel fuel\\nplume and the further action needed to ensure site remediation acceptable to the State. The\\ncorrective action plan called for the excavation of all contaminated soils at the leak site\\nthat exceeded 500 parts per million, in accordance with Tennessee underground storage\\ntank guidance cleanup guidelines.\\n\\nApproximately  18,000 tons  of  contaminated  soil were excavated  at  the  leak  site\\narea  during  March  and  April  1999.  The  excavated  soil  was  transported  to  Waste\\nManagement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chestnut Ridge Landfill for disposal under the approval of the Tennessee\\nDivision of Solid Waste Management. A well survey conducted shortly after the release\\nfound  no  residential  wells  in  the  leak  site  area.  The  limited  amount  of  affected\\ngroundwater encountered was treated on site. The March 3 plan stated that because the\\naffected groundwater immediately discharges to Goose Creek, it would not contaminate\\nother  portions  of  the  shallow  groundwater  system  and  would  not  affect  deeper\\ngroundwater. It was therefore determined that it was not necessary to install monitoring\\nwells at the leak site.\\n\\nCommunity Awareness \\n\\nAt the time of the spill, Colonial had in place a 14-point public education program\\nthat it had designed to meet the requirements of 49 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)\\nPart  195.440,  which  requires  oil  pipelines  to  conduct  public  educational  programs.4\\nColonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public education program included mailing safety flyers to a targeted audience,\\nincluding  apartment  dwellers,  living  within  1/8  mile  of  a  pipeline.  The  company  also\\nprovided direct mail pieces to those individuals who owned property where Colonial held\\neasements.  These  materials  included  an  annual  wall  calendar  and  a  Colonial  road  atlas\\nwith  a  companion  booklet  that  contained  general  information  about  the  company.  The\\natlas and booklet were distributed every 5 years. \\n\\nIn  areas  where  Colonial  deemed  excavator  risk  particularly  high,  company\\nrepresentatives participated in meetings to educate public officials, emergency responders,\\nand excavators. Additionally, the company distributed its atlas and companion booklet to\\nsome public officials and contractors. In both 1997 and 1998, Colonial had pipeline maps\\navailable for review at its tank farm during the emergency response coordination drills it\\nheld with the Knoxville Fire Department. \\n\\nA  review  conducted  in  the  immediate  area  of  the  pipeline  failure  disclosed  that\\nColonial pipeline easements crossed five residential properties. Colonial records indicate\\nthat various public education items were mailed to two of these residences in November\\nand  December  1997.  These  items  addressed  questions  such  as  how  to  detect  a  pipeline\\naccident,  what  to  do  in  case  of  an  accident,  and  how  to  report  an  accident.  Thirteen\\n\\n4 Under 49 CFR 195.440, each operator shall establish a continuing education program to enable the\\npublic,  appropriate  government  organizations,  and  persons  engaged  in  excavation-related  activities  to\\nrecognize a hazardous liquid pipeline emergency and to report it to the operator or the fire, police, or other\\nappropriate public officials.\\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c\\x12\\n\\nresidents were interviewed. Of those, residents from two households stated that they were\\naware  of  a  pipeline  in  the  immediate  area.  One  resident  recalled  receiving  a  pamphlet\\nexplaining  Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  brush-clearing  operation;  however,  no  one  was  aware  of  any\\nspecific reporting action or personal protection measures to take in the event of a pipeline\\nrelease, nor could they recall any safety awareness mailings from Colonial. \\n\\nThe  Knoxville  Fire  Department  hazardous  materials  emergency  response\\nprocedures  were  last  revised  and  approved  in  January  1999  by  the  Knoxville  County\\nEmergency  Management  Agency.  Fire  department  personnel  have  received  training  in\\nhazardous materials team operations provided by the Tennessee Emergency Management\\nAgency.  These  training  courses  cover  hazardous  materials  incident  response  (incident\\ncommand  system,  hazardous  material  identification,  notification,  protective  equipment,\\netc.) at the responder, operations specialist, and technician levels.\\n\\nAccording  to  fire  department  officials,  the  department  conducts  disaster  drills\\nannually. The most recent disaster drill before the accident was on September 9, 1998. The\\nscenario  involved  a  joint  multiagency  response  to  an  aircraft  crash  at  the  Knoxville\\nAirport. The last chemical transportation accident drill was conducted in November 1998.\\nThis  simulated  an  accident  that  involved  a  highway  cargo  tank  containing  acid  and  the\\nrelease of a toxic cloud that caused two injuries. In November 1997, the Knoxville Fire\\nDepartment and Colonial conducted a joint training drill at a petroleum products terminal\\nin Knoxville. The scenario involved a pipeline rupture at a storage tank and a 1,000-gallon\\ngasoline spill. During a tour of its facility during December 1998, Colonial discussed with\\nKnoxville  Fire  Department  personnel  its  pipeline  delivery  system,  spill  response\\nprocedures,  and  pipeline  location  maps  for  the  city  of  Knoxville.  In  its  review  of  this\\naccident,  the  Knoxville  Fire  Department  identified  internal  operations  problems  in  its\\nresponse,  including  the  use  of  trainees  and  the  fact  that  some  of  the  communications\\nchannels  monitored  by  the  fire  department  were  not  recorded.  Also,  fire  department\\nofficials identified an issue regarding the lack of pipeline location maps during the early\\nstage of the emergency, which might have helped them locate pipelines in the complaint\\narea. \\n\\nPipeline Information\\n\\nThe pipeline was constructed in 1962 and put into service in early 1963. The pipe\\ninstalled  was  10-inch-diameter,  Grade  5L  X-42,  0.250-inch  wall  thickness,  electric\\nresistance weld (ERW) steel pipe. At the rupture site, the pipeline was installed on a slope\\nand had a slight side bend to the left below the rupture (figure 1) in the downstream flow\\ndirection. Colonial records indicate that the pipe had asphalt enamel coating. A coating\\ndefect (wrinkled coating) was also evident 2 to 3 feet upstream of the rupture (figure 2).\\nSafety Board investigators and Colonial personnel observed no visible damage to the pipe\\ncoating  that  remained  immediately  adjacent  to  the  rupture  area  before  the  pipe  was\\nremoved for examination. Colonial did not have a toughness requirement5 for pipe when it\\nwas purchased for this pipeline, and no pipeline industry standards had been established at\\nthat  time.  Since  July  13,  1990,  Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  line  pipe  purchasing  specifications  have  had\\nminimum  toughness  requirements  that  include,  among  other  factors,  a  minimum\\nacceptance criteria of 25 ft/lbs of absorbed energy at 32\\xc2\\xb0 F for Charpy V-Notch (Charpy)\\nimpact tests.6   \\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c\\x13\\n\\nRupture \\n\\nSite\\n\\nFigure 1. Pipeline on slope showing side bend to the left \\nbeyond the rupture.\\n\\n5 As  a  result  of  its  investigation  of  a  March  23,  1994,  pipeline  accident  in  Edison,  New  Jersey,  the\\nSafety  Board  issued  the  following  safety  recommendation  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Transportation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nResearch and Special Programs Administration (RSPA):\\n\\nP-95-2\\nDevelop  toughness  standards  for  new  pipe  installed  in  gas  and  hazardous  liquid  pipelines,\\nespecially in urban areas.\\n\\nIn June 1995, in response to a request from RSPA, the American Petroleum Institute (API) organized a task\\ngroup  to  revise  the  specification  for  line  pipe,  API  Specification  5L,  to  include  minimum  toughness\\nrequirements. In January 2000, the revised 42nd Edition of API Specification 5L was published. It contains\\ntwo  pipe  product  specification  levels  with  Product  Specification  Level  2  (PSL-2)  having  a  required\\nminimum fracture toughness level for new pipe. Safety Recommendation P-95-2 remains \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOpen-Acceptable\\nResponse.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n6 Charpy V-Notch impact tests that measure the energy absorbed  by a given thickness of material at a\\n\\ngiven temperature were used to evaluate the fracture toughness of materials. \\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c\\x01\\n\\nRupture\\n\\nWrinkled\\nCoating\\n\\nFigure 2. Wrinkled coating 2 to 3 feet upstream of the circumferential crack that \\nterminates at the 9 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock position.\\n\\nA hydrostatic pressure test to 649 psig was completed on February 4, 1995, on the\\nEast  Knoxville  pipeline  segment.  The  maximum  operating  pressure  (MOP)  for  the\\npipeline was determined to be 519 psig at the Knoxville station, which calculates to 552\\npsig at the rupture location. The allowable surge pressure, based on pipeline Federal safety\\nregulations (1.1 x MOP), is 571 psig at the Knoxville station and 607 psig at the rupture\\nlocation.  Colonial  records  indicate  that  the  typical  operating  pressure  at  the  rupture\\nlocation  ranges  between  72  and  250  psig,  and  the  number  of  operating  cycles  for  that\\nrange is at least 144 per year for the East Knoxville section of the pipeline.\\n\\nInternal inspections with different types of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmart pigs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were performed in 1989\\nand  1999.  The  1989  inspection  was  done  using  a  conventional  magnetic  flux  internal\\ninspection tool. The internal inspection company graded the inspection log, and no defects\\nwere indicated at the rupture point. Colonial reported that repairs were made to other areas\\nof the pipeline as a result of the 1989 inspection. \\n\\nThe pipeline was internally inspected again using a high-resolution magnetic flux\\ninspection tool on February 8, 1999. The inspection tool became stuck at one of several\\ndents about 4,000 feet upstream of the East Knoxville station (about 1.7 miles downstream\\nof  the  rupture  site).  The  pipeline  was  pressurized  a  number  of  times  to  dislodge  the\\ninspection tool and push it ahead. SCADA logs indicate that the pressure on the pipeline\\nreached 546 psig at the Knoxville station, which calculates to approximately 580 psig at\\nthe rupture location. The effort to dislodge the tool using pressure was unsuccessful, and\\non the afternoon before the rupture, the section of pipe containing the tool was cut from\\nthe pipeline and replaced with new pipe. Product was transported through the line after the\\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c\\x01\\n\\nrepair.  The  high-resolution magnetic flux  inspection indicated no  defects such as  dents,\\ngouges, or significant corrosion at the failure location.\\n\\nColonial  uses  an  impressed  current  cathodic  protection7  system  to  protect  its\\npipelines.  Company  records  indicate  that  the  rectifier  system  was  operating  properly\\nbefore  the  accident.  Annual  corrosion  survey  records  for  3  years  prior  to  the  accident\\nindicate the pipe-to-soil potential levels8 were  \\xe2\\x80\\x930.85 volt or more negative with reference\\nto a copper-copper sulfate reference electrode.9 \\n\\nMaterials Laboratory Examination\\n\\nWhen the pipe was exposed, a circumferential crack was found around the top half\\nof the pipe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diameter (figure 3), and no pipe coating remained in the area of the crack.\\nThe crack was not located in a girth weld, visible dent, or gouge; however, the crack ran\\nthrough an area of surface corrosion. Close examination of the fracture surface established\\nthat  the  crack  initiated  at  an  area  with  at  least  nine  separate  darkly  colored  thumbnail-\\nshaped  corroded  regions  (thumbnails).  The  failure  initiation  region  was  centered  at  the\\n3 o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock position (looking downstream, toward East Knoxville) in the area of the external\\nsurface  corrosion.  The  thumbnail  shape,  dark  coloration,  and  fracture  surface  features\\nwere consistent with corroded preexisting cracks that initiated on the external surface of\\nthe  pipe  and  propagated  radially  inward.  None  of  these  preexisting  cracks  penetrated\\nthrough the pipe wall, with 0.120-inch being the deepest penetration observed, which was\\n48 percent of the nominal pipe wall thickness. Similar corroded preexisting cracks were\\nnoted nearby in the surface corrosion area.\\n\\nThe  crack  ran  in  both  directions  from  its  initiation  point.  The  crack  propagated\\nclockwise past the longitudinal weld seam. In the clockwise direction, the brittle fracture\\nextended less than 0.5 inch before changing to a ductile fracture.

Longitudinal pipe specimens were tested at\\ntemperatures ranging between 25\\xc2\\xb0 and 170\\xc2\\xb0 F. The full-size energy values11 for absorbed\\nenergy in the longitudinal direction were from 3.4 to 21.8 ft/lbs between 25\\xc2\\xb0 and 65\\xc2\\xb0 F,\\nand 40.2 ft/lbs at 85\\xc2\\xb0 F.

Colonial has also updated the\\neducational  information  in  its  safety  pamphlet  and  upgraded  the  method  by  which  the\\nsafety information is communicated to the target audience. Colonial has also updated its\\npublic education program mailings to better reach its target audience. The first paragraph\\nof  each  educational  mailing  now  encourages  the  initial  reader  to  share  the  information\\nwith all members of the household.\\n\\nIn  addition,  Colonial  has  upgraded  its  written  procedures  for  establishing  and\\nmaintaining liaison with fire, police, and other agencies that might respond to a hazardous\\nliquid  pipeline  emergency.  The  procedures  identify  the  methods  to  be  used,  the\\ninformation to be shared, and the frequency of the contacts.\\n\\nSince  the  Knoxville  accident,  Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  control  center  operations  manual  for\\nabnormal  and  emergency  operations  has  been  amended  to  include  the  following:  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAny\\ntime  an  unscheduled  shutdown  occurs,  the  line  will  only  be  re-started  with  the\\nconcurrence of a Senior Controller.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d At the time of the accident, Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s control center\\noperations  manual  directed  that  for  continuous  minor  hourly  shortages,  the  controller\\nwould  investigate  by  having  all  active  facilities  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprove\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (verify  the  accuracy  of)  the\\nmeters.  If  proving  meters  did  not  correct  the  shortages,  controllers  were  to  contact  the\\nsenior  controller  for  a  decision  to  possibly  pressure-test  the  line  or  shut  it  down  for\\ninspection.  Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  control  center  operations  manual  for  emergency  operations\\ninvolving leaks or suspected leaks has been amended to include the following: \\n\\nAny time a line is shut down to investigate a continuous minor hourly shortage,\\nthe line will only be re-started with the concurrence of a representative from the\\nEngineering Services Team.\\n\\nColonial  is  using  the  details surrounding  this  event  in  various  training scenarios\\nand  has  added  the  Knoxville  accident  scenario  to  its  maximum  critical  event  training.\\nColonial uses simulator training as part of its controller training.\\n\\nColonial  is  continuing  its  efforts  to  install  an  automated  leak  detection  system.\\nColonial  is  currently  installing  a  batch  tracking  system  on  a  Colonial  stubline  system\\nsimilar to the one involved in this accident. This new system is expected to aid the pipeline\\ncontroller in identifying variances in the amount of product shipped versus the amount of\\nproduct delivered. Any discrepancies identified above a predetermined threshold will be\\ninvestigated as a possible leak. Colonial has experienced some difficulty in completing the\\ninstallation of this system but anticipates completion in the first half of 2001. Once the\\nfirst  system  is  successfully  installed,  Colonial  anticipates  installing  the  batch  tracking\\nsystem  on  other  stublines.  When  all  the  stublines  are  addressed,  Colonial  anticipates\\nattempting to apply the same batch tracking system to the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mainlines, although\\nthe company expressed some concern about the effect that the size and the complexity of\\nthe mainlines will have on the performance of the batch tracking system.\\n\\nColonial is developing a formal, documented strategic plan on how to approach the\\nidentification,  evaluation,  and  application  of  technology  to  leak  detection  on  Colonial\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c11\\n\\nsystem. This plan is scheduled to be fully developed in 2001. The objective of the plan is\\nto  find  and  implement  effective  means  of  leak  detection  and  to  comply  with  the  new\\nOffice  of  Pipeline  Safety  regulations  on  integrity  management  of  pipelines  that  affect\\nhigh-consequences areas.\\n\\nThe  Knoxville  Fire  Department  incident  commander  held  a  postaccident\\ndebriefing with Knoxville communication center personnel, established  new procedures\\nfor  the  communications  center,  and  requested  that  Colonial  provide  maps  for  fire\\ndepartment use. Because of the delay in notifying Colonial that occurred in this accident,\\nprocedures have been changed so that (1) the communications center will not rely solely\\non dispatcher trainees during periods of heavy workload; (2) the supervisors will assist the\\ndispatcher  during  periods  of  heavy  workload;  and  (3)  the  communications  center  will\\nrecord  all  communications  channels  to  create  a  record  of  emergency  response\\nconversations.\\n\\nAlso  at  the  request  of  the  Knoxville  Fire  Department,  Colonial  provided  the\\ndepartment with pipeline location maps to be carried by fire department units responding\\nto calls involving the possible release of hazardous materials. The department also uses\\nthe maps during annual fire department training sessions at the Colonial terminal facility.\\n\\nProbable Cause\\n\\nThe National Transportation  Safety Board determines that the probable cause of\\nthis  accident  was  pipe  rupture  initiated  by  environment-induced  cracking  in  an  area  of\\npipe  coating  failure.  A  contributing  factor  to  the  failure  was  the  relatively  low  fracture\\ntoughness of the pipe. Contributing to the severity of the accident was Colonial Pipeline\\nCompany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to determine from the supervisory control and data acquisition system\\nthat a leak had occurred, with the result that the pipeline controller started and restarted the\\npipeline, thereby increasing the amount of diesel fuel that was released. \\n\\nApproved: March 28, 2001\\n\\nNTSB/PAB-01/01\\n\\n\\x0c'"

Investigators -found a break in an underground 1 1/4-inch steel natural gas distribution service line that was -operating  at  11  1/2  pounds  per  square  inch,  gauge.  The  break  occurred  at  an  underground -threaded tee connection downstream from where excavators were removing an oil tank that was -buried  under  the  asphalt  parking  lot  adjacent  to  the  building.  The  break  occurred,  under  the -parking  lot,  about  7  feet  4  inches  from  the  building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  wall.  Three  residents  of  the  apartment -building were killed. Four residents and a tank removal worker were injured and transported to -hospitals. The property damage consisted of the apartment building, which was a complete loss. -(See  figure  1.) According  to  Bergen  County  tax  records,  the  assessed  value  of  the  apartment -building was $863,300. --JP  Management,  a  real  estate  company  that  owned  the  apartment  building,  hired  the -American Tank Service Company (American Tank) to remove and replace the buried oil tank. -On  December  5,  2005,  American  Tank  requested  markouts2  of  the  utilities  at  30  Elm  Street -through the New Jersey One Call System.3 On December 7, 2005, a Public Service Electric and -                                                 --1 All times are eastern standard time. -2 A markout is a ground marking that is typically color coded and that indicates the location of underground --utilities. --3 New Jersey One Call is a one-call operation for anyone planning to dig (excavation, demolition, blasting), --regardless of the size of the project. This operation is for both commercial construction and homeowners. --1--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cGas Company (PSE&G)4 street inspector went to the site and marked the location of the buried -gas service line to the building. The marked location showed that the service line ran under the -parking lot and about parallel to the building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wall. At a point downstream of the excavation -area, the pipeline turned 90o toward the building. (See figure 2.) -- --Figure 1. Damage caused by explosion. --About 8:30 a.m. on Monday, December 12, the American Tank crew arrived at the site, -saw the gas and water utility markouts, and began excavating in the asphalt parking lot that was -adjacent to the building. The work contract indicated that the tank capacity was 2,000 gallons. -According to the American Tank foreman, when the excavation was about 30 inches deep, the -top of the tank was exposed. At this time, the crew realized that the tank was a 5,000-gallon tank -rather  than  a  2,000-gallon  tank.5  Because  the  larger  tank  was  wider,  longer,  and  heavier  than -expected, and thus closer to the natural gas service line, the excavation crew had concerns about -its  safe  removal.  In  an  interview,  one  of  the  crewmembers  stated,  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[At  the  time]  I  said  our -concern is once we move the tank or roll it over, to roll it and take it out, it may undermine the -gas line.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d An American Tank vice president went to the site to verify that it was a larger tank and -to reassess its removal. He arranged for his office staff to call New Jersey One Call for a second -markout of the utilities. The PSE&G inspector arrived at the apartment building about 11:14 a.m. -and re-marked the gas service line. He made a slight change to the original marking where the -gas line entered the building. -                                                 -oldest and largest publicly owned utility. --4 PSE&G is one of the largest combined electric and gas companies in the United States and is New Jersey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s --5  Based  on  the  length  and  depth  of  the  tank,  an  American  Tank  vacuum  truck  operator  referred  to  the  tank -capacity reference books that he carried in his truck and correctly determined the capacity of the tank to be 5,000 -gallons. --2--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cFigure 2. Diagram of accident site. -- --3--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cThe American Tank foreman told investigators that on December 12 he asked the PSE&G -inspector  whether  the  gas  line  could  be  shut  off  while  they  excavated.  This  request  was  a -precaution to prevent the release of gas if the line was damaged during the tank removal. The -PSE&G inspector told investigators he stated to the American Tank foreman that because it was -wintertime the gas could not be shut off. However, the PSE&G inspector said that he would ask -his  supervisor.  When  the  supervisor  told  the  inspector  that  turning  off  the  natural  gas  to  the -building would not be possible, the inspector informed the American Tank foreman. According to -the  PSE&G,  shutting  off  the  gas  to  the  building  without  making  prior  arrangements  with  the -PSE&G and the building\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner would have created a health risk to the residents by leaving -them without gas for heat, hot water, and cooking. --The American Tank foreman and assistant manager said during postaccident interviews -that,  based  on  their  examination  of  the  worksite  after  the  initial  excavation,  they  thought  the -excavation was stable and secure, and the excavation wall was far enough from the pipe to be -safe. However, the American Tank crew did not evaluate the soil at the walls of the ditch for -stability.6  --The  excavation  crew  exposed  a  portion  of  the  gas  pipeline  by  excavating  with  hand -shovels  to  confirm  the  service  line\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  location.  The  excavation  was  done  by  digging  into  the -eastern  trench  wall,  near  the  gas  pipeline  and  the  building,  while  standing  in  the  trench.  The -PSE&G street inspector who had marked the pipeline told Safety Board investigators that he was -on site when the service line was first uncovered. The service line was partially exposed in two -locations that were each about 1 foot long. The service line was buried about 30 to 36 inches and -was about 2 feet from the extended eastern edge of the trench. To excavate the 5,000-gallon tank, -the crew had to open a trench that was about 24 feet long, which was considerably larger than -originally planned.  --The PSE&G inspector determined that the pipeline was a PSE&G gas pipeline and that it -was  accurately  marked.  According  to  the  inspector,  he  reminded  the  American  Tank -crewmembers  of  their  obligation  to  protect  the  gas  pipe  from  damage  by  supporting  the  pipe -against an immovable object, such as the building, or shoring the trench. The PSE&G inspector -did not remain on the job to ensure that the pipeline was adequately protected. In addition, he did -not attempt to test the curb valve to ensure it could be rapidly closed if the pipeline was broken. -The  inspector  gave  the American Tank  foreman his  business  card  and  asked  him  to  call  if  he -needed assistance or had any questions. The inspector departed the site at 11:47 a.m. According -to the American Tank foreman, the trench was not shored and was about 4 to 5 feet deep at the -end of the first day.  --The American Tank  crew  (assistant  manager,  foreman,  and  two  crewmembers)  arrived -about  8:30  a.m.  on  Tuesday,  December  13,  2005,  to  continue  work  on  the  excavation.  The -American Tank crewmembers told Safety Board investigators that they did not start any of the -excavation equipment or expand the excavation on December 13, the day of the accident. When -they  first  arrived,  they  saw  that  the  ground  surrounding  the  pipeline  had  collapsed  and  fallen -from  underneath  portions  of  the  asphalt  parking  lot  along  the  eastern  wall  of  the  trench. The -                                                 -6  Trench  wall  soils  can  be  tested  for  stability  by  using  a  penetrometer,  which  is  a  mechanical  device  that -measures the force needed for a probe to enter the soil. Another method is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthumb test,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in which the thumb is -pushed into the soil along the wall. --4--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0ccrewmembers said that they tied one end of a rope to the gas pipeline and the other end to the oil -tank vent pipe at the building wall in an effort to help support the pipeline. The American Tank -crew  also  placed  a  pump  into  the  trench  and  was  removing  some  of  the  water  that  had -accumulated  when  some  crewmembers  reported  hearing  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpopping\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  sound  and  two -crewmembers  smelled  natural  gas.  Shortly  afterward,  the  other  two  crewmembers  smelled -natural gas.  --From across the street, a local business owner saw the American Tank crew working at 30 -Elm Street. He said that he saw water flowing down the road and when he went across the street -to where the American Tank crew was working, he smelled natural gas. The business owner said -that he would call the police for them. He called the Bergenfield Police Department7 at 8:49 a.m. -and  reported  a  gas  leak.  His  call  was  the  only  one  that  the  Bergenfield  Police  Department -received about the incident before the explosion. An apartment resident later told Safety Board -investigators that she also had smelled natural gas, but had not called the police department, the -fire department, or the PSE&G. The American Tank foreman called the PSE&G at 8:54 a.m. and -reported that the ground had collapsed and the service line was broken. --According  to  the  Bergenfield  Police  Department  dispatch  logs,  at  8:52  a.m.,  the -Bergenfield Fire Department\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chief,8 a fire official,9 and an engine company responded to an -initial notification of a gas leak. Two Bergenfield Police Department police officers were also -dispatched. A  Bergenfield  police  officer  directed traffic  away  from  the  area. After  arriving  on -scene about 8:54 a.m., the fire chief asked the police dispatchers to notify the PSE&G. At 8:58 -a.m.,  police  dispatchers  notified  the  PSE&G  of  the  incident. The  fire  chief  told  Safety  Board -investigators that he had not observed any signs of a leak at the trench (that is, smelling gas, -hearing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chissing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sound, or seeing bubbling of water in the trench). The fire official said that he -did  not  smell  gas  at  the  scene.  No  one  from  the  Bergenfield  Fire  Department  checked  the -apartment  building  for  the  presence  of  natural  gas.  The  fire  department  did  not  attempt  to -evacuate the building before the explosion. --The Bergenfield fire chief said that the American Tank crew warned him, before the -explosion, about the soil giving way in the trench and to be careful while walking near the -trench. The  fire  chief  also  said  that  he  looked  into  the  trench  and  could  see  that  the  soil -beneath the asphalt on the east side of the trench had fallen into the trench.  --About 9:22 a.m., a PSE&G service technician arrived on scene. The technician attempted -to close the curb valve to shut off the gas, but he was unable to apply enough force to close it. In -a  postaccident  interview,  the  service  technician  said  that  as  he  approached  the  building  to -investigate  the  gas  leak,  an American  Tank  crewmember  told  him  to  not  get  too  close  to  the -trench because it had already collapsed. The service technician said that he had seen a piece of -asphalt  that  had  fallen  into  the  trench.  The  service  technician,  using  a  portable  gas  detector, --                                                 --7 The Bergenfield Police Department dispatches the police department and the fire department. -8 The Bergenfield Fire Department was composed mostly of volunteers. The fire chief, a volunteer, served for a --1-year term. --9  Bergenfield  had  five  career  fire  officials  who  conducted  site  inspections  and  fire  investigations.  The  fire --officials also responded to fire incidents. --5--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cdetected a positive gas reading just inside the boiler room doorway of the apartment building. He -started moving away from the building as it exploded at 9:26 a.m. --The police and fire departments, American Tank, and the PSE&G started rescue actions. -The fire departments started firefighting. About 10:00 a.m., a PSE&G street crew was able to -shut off the gas to the service line by closing the curb valve. --Inspection and Recovery of Pipeline --When the pipeline was later uncovered during the postaccident excavation, a frayed rope -was found attached to the gas pipeline. Additionally, a broken piece of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo-by-four\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lumber was -found near the gas pipeline.  --During  pressure  tests  on  the  steel  service  line,  the  only  leak  was  found  at  the  iron -threaded tee connection that was about 7 feet 4 1/2 inches from the building wall. The tee had -separated from the service line and had a gap of about 3 inches. (See figure 3.) The tee and the -separated  end  of  the  service  line  were  removed  and  sent  to  the  Safety  Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Materials -Laboratory for analysis.  --Figure 3. Separation of steel service line. -- --The threaded end of the service line fractured at the connection. The exposed threads on -either  side  of  the  mating  surfaces  showed  no  evidence  of  corrosion  degradation  or  fatigue -cracking. Microscopic examination of the fracture revealed features consistent with an overstress -separation. The evidence is consistent with the pipeline separating in overstress after the ground -collapsed into the trench and caused the pipeline to move. -- --6--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cAmerican Tank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Procedures and Training --American  Tank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  written  procedures  covered  certifications  and  licensing,  obtaining -contracts,  the  steps  from  signed  contract  to  job  execution,  and  the  steps  for  job  completion. -American Tank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s written procedures for excavation work were limited to using the New Jersey -One Call System for marking buried utilities, including gas pipelines. The company did not have -written operating procedures for the protection of utilities while excavating.  --According  to  American  Tank,  its  unwritten  procedures  for  the  protection  of  utilities --included the following: --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Visit the job site to survey for hazards and logistical issues. --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Obtain all needed permits. --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Survey the job site to ensure markings are in place. --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Uncover the top of the tank to determine its direction and hand excavation of nearby --utilities. --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Evaluate the nature of the soil to determine the possibility of collapse. --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Contact the utility company and request shutoff. --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Protect and support the utility; contact the utility company if damaged.  --\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 --If  damage  to  the  utility  is  observed,  call  the  emergency  telephone  numbers  for  the -utility and call 911 or fire and police department emergency telephone numbers.  --American Tank had no formal training program on the protection and support of utilities.  --PSE&G\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Excavation  Damage  Prevention  Program  and  Emergency -Plan --The  PSE&G  participated  in  the  New  Jersey  One  Call  system.

American Tank was cited for a probable -violation of the New Jersey Underground Facility Protection Act for not planning the excavation -to  avoid  damage  and  minimize  interference  with  an  underground  facility  and  not  using -reasonable care in an excavation.  --The Board of Public Utilities cited the PSE&G for three probable violations of 49 CFR -Part 192. The first probable violation was that the PSE&G employee, after being notified of a -potential hazard, left the site with the potential hazard remaining. The second probable violation -was that the PSE&G\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response did not facilitate the most effective course of action under the -circumstances following the notice of a reported gas leak and ruptured service on December 13, -2005. The third probable violation was that the PSE&G did not have sufficient communication -and  exchange  of  information  with  the  Bergenfield  fire  officials  regarding  its  gas  emergency -programs.  The  outcome  of  the  citations  to American  Tank  and  the  PSE&G  is  pending  as  of -May 1, 2007. --U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration --OSHA  investigated  this  accident.  Title  29  CFR  1926.651  establishes  excavation -requirements  designed  to  safeguard  employees  and  prevent  damage  to  underground  utilities, -including a requirement to establish the location of underground installations before excavating.  --8--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cOSHA  and American Tank  reached  a  stipulated  agreement  for  two  violations  in  which -American Tank was fined for its conduct during this accident. American Tank was cited for the -failure to use safe and acceptable means to exactly locate the underground vent pipe for the oil -storage tank and for the failure to safeguard employees while the excavation was open.  --Federal Pipeline Safety Requirements --The  Pipeline  and  Hazardous  Materials  Safety  Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  (PHMSA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s)  pipeline -safety  regulations  require  that  each  operator  of  a  buried  natural  gas  pipeline  must  carry  out  a -written program to prevent damage to the pipeline from excavation activities. Specifically, in 49 -CFR  192.614(c),  the  damage  prevention  program  must  provide  for  the  inspection  of  those -pipelines  that  an  operator  \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas  reason  to  believe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  could  be  damaged  by  excavation  activities. -These  inspections  must  be  done  as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrequently  as  necessary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  during  and  after  the  excavation -activities to verify the integrity of the pipeline. --Title 49 CFR 192.615(a) requires that each natural gas pipeline operator have a written -emergency plan that establishes procedures for minimizing the hazards resulting from a natural -gas  pipeline  emergency.  The  emergency  plan  must  address  several  emergency  responses, -including  emergency  shutdown  and  pressure  reduction  in  any  section  of  the  pipeline  system -necessary  to  minimize  hazards  to  life  or  property  and  elimination  of  any  actual  or  potential -hazard to life or property. --Industry Guidance --The  Gas  Piping  Technology  Committee10  (GPTC)  publishes  the  Guide  for  Gas -Transmission  and  Distribution  Piping  Systems  to  help  natural  gas  operators  ensure  regulatory -compliance.  The  section  of  the  GPTC  guide  referring  to  Section  192.614c(6)  states  the -following:  --Where required, the inspection may include periodic or full-time surveillance and -may include leakage surveys during and after construction. The operator should -consider  maintaining  field  contact  with  the  excavator  during  the  excavation -activities to avoid potential problems. --The section of the GPTC guide referring to Section 192.615(a) states, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe objective of -the (emergency) plan should be to ensure that personnel who could be involved in an emergency -are prepared to recognize and deal with the situation in an expeditious and safe manner.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d --The  Common  Ground  Alliance  Best  Practices11  manual,  version  3.0,  states  that  the -excavator  must  use  reasonable  care  to  avoid  damaging  underground  facilities. The  excavator -                                                 -from industry, government, and the public. --10 The GPTC is an American National Standards Institute technical committee composed of technical specialists --11 The Common Ground Alliance, composed of technical specialists from industry, government, and the public, -provides a guide on underground utility damage prevention best practices and promotes their use throughout the -United States. --9--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cshould  plan  the  excavation  to  avoid  damage  or  minimize  interference  with  the  underground -facilities  in  or  near  the  work  area.  The  manual  also  states  that  the  protection  of  exposed -underground facilities is as important as preventing damage to the facility when digging around -the utility. Section 5-22 of the manual indicates that excavators are to support or brace exposed -underground facilities and protect them from moving or shifting, which could result in damage to -the  facility.  Methods  to  support,  brace,  and  protect  these  facilities  include  shoring  the  facility -from below or providing a timber support with hangers across the top of the excavation to ensure -that the facility does not move or bend. --Excess Flow Valves --Excess flow valves are designed to respond to an excessive flow of gas by automatically -closing and restricting the gas flow, thereby reducing the likelihood of an explosion and fire. The -valves are typically installed at the connection of a service line to a main pipeline. The valves -can greatly reduce the consequences of service line breaks. The investigation examined whether -an  excess  flow  valve  that  was  compatible  with  the  operating  conditions  for  the  apartment -building would have been effective. Had the break in the service line been exposed to the open -atmosphere, an excess flow valve would have activated immediately to restrict the flow of gas; -however,  in  this  accident,  the  broken  section  of  pipe  was  underground  and  under  asphalt -pavement. --A leakage test conducted 2 days after the accident resulted in a flow rate of natural gas -through  the  broken  service  line  of  about  1,600  standard  cubic  feet  per  hour. The  leakage  test -could not be conducted until the excavation site was stabilized.12 Soil conditions at the time of -the  leakage  test  were  significantly  different  than  at  the  time  the  service  line  was  broken;  this -difference likely affected the flow rate measured during the test. Further, the flow rate of natural -gas to the apartment building at the time the service line was fractured cannot be determined.13 -At  the  time  of  the  accident,  it  was  quite  cold;  the  temperature  was  about  18\\xc2\\xb0  F.  It  would  be -reasonable to assume that the heating system and the replenishment of hot water for the tenants -would  have  been  operating  near  maximum  capacity.  However,  given  the  uncertainty  in  the -leakage test results and the unknown flow rate to the building, the Safety Board was not able to -determine whether an excess flow valve, had one been installed, would have activated after the -service line was broken in this accident. --Bergenfield Fire Department Procedures and Training --According  to  the  fire  chief,  the  Bergenfield  Fire  Department  did  not  have  written -procedures  for  natural  gas  incidents.  Safety  Board  investigators  were  told  in  Fire  Department --                                                 -12  During  the  firefighting  operations,  significant  amounts  of  water  had  been  used  in  the  area.  The  trench -adjacent to the broken section of pipe had been filled as a precautionary measure due to concerns that the building -wall might collapse. Later, the trench was partially excavated then refilled because of unstable soil. Trench boxes -were necessary to stabilize the excavation before the investigators could access the site.  --13 The flow rate to the building could not exceed 2,500 standard cubic feet per hour because of the capacity of --the metering equipment. --10--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cinterviews that the Bergenfield Fire Department relied heavily on the assistance of the PSE&G in -deciding whether to evacuate a structure. --Effective  July  5,  2005,  the  State  of  New  Jersey  improved  its  written  course  material -regarding natural gas hazards for Firefighter I training. The new material is in the Firefighter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s -Handbook:  Essentials  of  Firefighting  and  Emergency  Response\\xe2\\x80\\x94New  Jersey  Edition,  and -Addendum. In this handbook, Section D, Chapter II, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRecognizing and Avoiding the Hazards of -Natural  Gas  and  Carbon  Monoxide,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  describes  the  properties  of  natural  gas,  the  natural  gas -delivery  system,  natural  gas  detection,  and  the  response  to  natural  gas  emergencies.  In  the -section, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecure the Site,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the manual has the following recommendation:  --When the presence of gas is strong, the best rule is to evacuate people from the -dwelling  and  move  them  across  the  street  or  a  distance  far  away  that  would -prevent injuries if the structure were to explode.  --The  video  Natural  Gas:  Recognizing  and  Avoiding  the  Hazards,  which  was  produced -with the cooperation of several companies and government agencies in New Jersey, including the -PSE&G, is also included as part of the Firefighter I course. --As a result of a July 1999 accident in Fairlawn, New Jersey, and a March 2006 agreement -with the Board of Public Utilities, the PSE&G agreed to expand its emergency response training, -which  is  coordinated  with  the  Bergen  County  Fire  Academy.  As  a  result  of  the  Bergenfield -accident and a March 2006 agreement between the Board of Public Utilities and the PSE&G, the -Board  of  Public  Utilities  obtained  permission  to  distribute  a  PSE&G-produced  video  for -firefighters and first responders in the State of New Jersey. This video includes information on -how to handle gas leak emergencies, and when to check the building, and when to evacuate. --In October 2006, the PSE&G mailed a computer disk containing electric and gas hazard -awareness  information  to  police  departments,  fire  departments,  and  emergency  management -officials within the PSE&G\\xe2\\x80\\x99s service area to help them to develop standard operating procedures -for electrical and gas emergencies. --Probable Cause --The  National  Transportation  Safety  Board  determines  that  the  probable  cause  of  the -December 13, 2005, natural gas explosion and fire in Bergenfield, New Jersey, was the failure of -the American  Tank  Service  Company  to  adequately  protect  the  natural  gas  service  line  from -shifting soil during excavation, which resulted in damage to the service line and the release and -migration of natural gas into the apartment building. Contributing to the accident was the failure -of the Public Service Electric and Gas Company to conduct effective oversight of the excavation -activities  adjacent  to  the  gas  service  line  and  to  be  prepared  to  promptly  shut  off  the  flow  of -natural gas after the service line was damaged. Contributing to the casualties in the accident was -the  failure  of  the  Bergenfield  Fire  Department  to  evacuate  the  apartment  building  despite  the -strong evidence of a natural gas leak and the potential for gas to migrate into the building. --11--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0cRecommendations --As  a  result  of  its  investigation  of  the  Bergenfield,  New  Jersey,  pipeline  accident,  the -National Transportation Safety Board made the safety recommendations listed below.

Our  investigation -found serious deficiencies in practices and procedures followed by the excavation contractor, the -utility company, and the community of Bergenfield. We make recommendations to the State of -New Jersey concerning recurrent training for firefighters in dealing with gas leaks. We ask the -contractor to implement written procedures. We make similar and appropriate recommendations -to  the  Borough  of  Bergenfield,  the  Public  Service  Electric  and  Gas  Company,  and  the -International Association of Fire Chiefs. --I am concerned that we could see a similar accident in another community. I believe the -best way to prevent a similar tragedy is to ask PHMSA, the Federal agency with regulatory and -enforcement responsibility for pipeline safety, to take a leadership role in helping all states and -communities understand the mistakes that led to this accident so they can be addressed.  --I am pleased that the Board voted to adopt a recommendation to PHMSA to spread the -word about this accident to emergency planning and response grant recipients so that training -funded by these grants will incorporate the lessons learned from the Bergenfield tragedy.  --Member Hersman joined Member Higgins in this statement. --13--NTSB/PAB-07/01 --\\x0c'"

       "' On  August  21,  2004,  about  8:54  a.m.,  a  natural  gas  explosion  destroyed  a  residence located  at  48  Woodland  Lane  in  DuBois,  Pennsylvania.  The  two  residents  were  killed  in  this accident. (See figure 1.) Postaccident Investigation National Fuel Gas Distribution Corporation (National Fuel) probed the ground near the residence for gas leaks. Combustible gastoair readings were found in two areas: one area was adjacent to the affected residence, and the other area was directly over the failed pipe on the front lawn.  After  the  explosion,  National  Fuel  excavated  the  front  lawn.  The  excavation  revealed  a leaking buttfusion joint in a 2inchdiameter plastic main line pipe. (See figure 2.) A buttfusion joint is made by the following process. A heater plate is inserted between two pipe ends, melting the material on each end. The heater is then removed, and the pipe ends are pushed together under applied force. The pipe ends remain under applied force as the pipe ends cool and fuse together. The buttfusion process forces excess molten plastic onto the inside and outside of the pipe surfaces. Because both sides of the pipe are molten, two visible beads are formed on the exterior and interior of the pipe joint. (See figure 3.) When this material cools and solidifies, it is called a fusion bead.                                                   1 All times in this brief are eastern daylight time. '"

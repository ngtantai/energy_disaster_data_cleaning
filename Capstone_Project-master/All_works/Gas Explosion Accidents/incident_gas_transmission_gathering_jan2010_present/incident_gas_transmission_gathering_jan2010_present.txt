THE LEAK IS IN A CLASS 3 HCA LOCATION. LEL LEVELS WERE MEASURED TO BE 18% DIRECTLY AT THE LEAK AND 0% WHEN INSTRUMENT IS REMOVED FROM THE WELD. THE LEAK IS FROM THE WELD OF THE SADDLE TO THE 6 INCH PIPE OF JM-8.  IT IS WELDED AT THE NECK OF THE 3 INCH TAP FOR JM-9.  THERE MUST BE A LEAKING WELD AT THE TAP FITTING WELD IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE LEAKING FROM THE SADDLE WELD.  WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK UNTIL REPAIR IS COMPLETED. AS OF JULY 13, 2017 WE ARE WAITING ON PARTS FOR REPAIR AND MONITORING LEAK DAILY UNTIL REPAIRS ARE COMPLETED.  THERE ARE SEVERAL DWELLINGS AND A CHURCH WITHIN 660FT OF THE LEAK SITE, WHICH PROMPTED A 20% DROP IN PRESSURE FROM 675 PSIG TO 540 PSIG OR LESS. WHILE PLANNING THE REPAIR IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE ESTIMATED REPAIR COSTS COULD EXCEED $50,000, MEETING THE DEFINITION OF AN INCIDENT. DUE TO THIS, NOTIFICATION WAS PROVIDED TO THE NRC ON JUNE 16, 2017 (NRC #1181336). A FOLLOW UP CALL WAS PLACED TO THE NRC ON JUNE 18, 2017 (NRC #1181499).

THE LEAK WAS PROMPTLY REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, THE ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION, THE PHMSA ANCHORAGE OFFICE, AND OTHER AGENCIES.     PLEASE NOTE THE NRC REPORT WAS TAKEN IN THE EASTERN TIME ZONE, A 4-HOUR TIME ZONE DIFFERENCE FROM THE ALASKA TIME ZONE.    THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED BY AN AERIAL PATROL DISPATCHED BY PIPELINE OPERATORS UPON OBSERVING DISCREPANCIES IN GAS METER READINGS.  PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED, AND INSPECTION AND REPAIR PLANNING INITIATED.  THE CAUSE OF THE NATURAL GAS LEAK IS STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION.  INSPECTION AND REPAIR ARE COMPLICATED BY WINTER CONDITIONS IN COOK INLET.  BROKEN ICE, EXACERBATED BY HIGH TIDAL FLOWS AND LIMITED DAYLIGHT PREVENT THE IMMEDIATE DISPATCH OF DIVERS TO INSPECT AND CONTAIN THE LEAK.      REGARDING PART A, ITEM NO. 10 - THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED AND VERIFIED AS INDICATED AT 15:23 ON 2/7/17.  HILCORP IS IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE ONSET DATE OF THE LEAK, AND SPECIFICALLY IF IT WAS PRIOR TO 2/7/17.    REGARDING PART E, ITEM 5A. AND 5.B. - AS IDENTIFIED IN THIS NARRATIVE AS WELL AS PART A, ITEM 15, THE PIPELINE WAS NOT SHUT DOWN DUE TO RISK OF ADVERSE IMPACTS.  THIS QUESTION ONLY ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO SELECT WHAT TYPE OF UPSTREAM (5A) AND DOWNSTREAM (5B) VALVE WAS USED TO ISOLATE THE PIPELINE; THUS A SELECTION NECESSARY IN THIS FIELD IN ORDER TO SUBMIT THE REPORT.  THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM VALVES REMAIN OPEN AS COMMUNICATED THROUGH THIS AND OTHER VENUE'S.     THE LEAK IS LOCATED 2.6 MILES FROM THE NEAREST PLATFORM AND APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES FROM SHORE.  THE LEAK RATE IS APPROXIMATELY 210-310 MCF/DAY.  THE U.S. COAST GUARD ISSUED A NOTICE TO MARINERS (NOTAM) REQUESTING THAT MARINERS STAY OUTSIDE OF A 1000-YARD RADIUS OF THE LEAK LOCATION.  HILCORP BELIEVES THAT THE REMOTE LOCATION AND SIZE OF THE LEAK RESULTS IN A LOW RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY.  HILCORP IS CLOSELY MONITORING THE LEAK FOR ANY CHANGES AND IS CONTINUING TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR MITIGATION.      HILCORP WOULD LIKE TO SHUT IN THE LINE BUT HAS NOT DONE SO BECAUSE THAT ACTION COULD CREATE ADDITIONAL HAZARDS.  SPECIFICALLY, IF GAS PRESSURE IS NOT MAINTAINED, SEAWATER WOULD ENTER THE PIPELINE THROUGH THE LEAK AND RESIDUAL CRUDE OIL IN THE GAS LINE COULD ENTER THE COOK INLET.  GAS LINE SHUT-IN COULD ALSO RESULT IN FREEZE UP AND POTENTIAL LEAKS ON THE PARALLEL CRUDE OIL FLOW LINE.  THE CRUDE OIL FLOW LINE DELIVERS A THREE-PHASE MIXTURE OF PRODUCED LIQUID TO THE ONSHORE PRODUCTION FACILITY, WITH A WATER CUT OF BETWEEN 50 AND 60%.      HILCORP SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS HAVE IDENTIFIED POTENTIALLY AFFECTED FISH AND MARINE MAMMALS AND BELIEVE, BASED ON CURRENT MODELING, THAT THE RISKS OF HARM TO THESE ANIMALS IS LOW.  HILCORP IS CONTINUING TO FOCUS ON POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO ANIMALS AND HABITAT, AND TO WORK WITH STATE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATORS ON MONITORING AND ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS.  TO DATE, HILCORP'S EXPERTS HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED ANY DOCUMENTED STUDIES THAT SHOW SPECIFIC METHANE-DRIVEN HARM TO COOK INLET FISH OR MARINE MAMMALS."

THE RESPONDING PERSONNEL MADE THE AREA SAFE BY VALVING OFF THE GAS TO THE INVOLVED FACILITY.  THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT A PRESSURE REGULATING DEVICE FAILED TO REDUCE THE INCOMING PRESSURE TO THE LOWER SET POINT.  THE PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICE DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATOR ALSO FAILED TO ACTIVATE TO RELIEVE THE OVERPRESSURE CONDITION.  THESE FAILURES ALLOWED 600 PSI NATURAL GAS PRESSURE TO REACH THE LOW PRESSURE REGULATORS UTILIZED FOR INSTRUMENT GAS AND BURNER FUEL GAS IN THE DEHYDRATOR EQUIPMENT.  THESE FIVE LOW PRESSURE DEVICES EXPERIENCED BRITTLE METAL FAILURE FROM THE HIGH PRESSURE GAS AND LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURES.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION / ADDITIONAL ROOT CAUSES:  THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND ASSOCIATED ANALYSIS PROVIDED THE CONCLUSION THAT INTERNAL CORROSION CAUSED THE PIPING RUPTURE. THINNING OF THE PIPE WALL WAS CAUSED BY SALT WATER CORROSION, ULTIMATELY LOWERING RUPTURE RESISTANCE.    ON NOVEMBER 19, 2015, EMPLOYEES AT STATION 535 DISCOVERED GAS LEAKING UP THROUGH THE GROUND IN THE STATION YARD AND UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THE SOURCE TO BE THE 20 INCH UNDERGROUND LINE ON THE INLET SIDE OF STATION'S DEHYDRATION.  THIS LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN AND TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE AS PLANS WERE PUT INTO PLACE FOR REPAIRS.  IT WAS IMMEDIATELY CONFIRMED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY INTERNAL CORROSION.  THE REPAIR CONSISTED OF REMOVING CORRODED PIPING UNTIL PIPING OF SUFFICIENT INTEGRITY WAS FOUND TO TIE NEW PIPING BACK INTO.  THIS REPAIR WORK WAS ALSO USED AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REMOVE DEAD HEADS AND OTHER PIPING IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY THAT WERE NO LONGER USED OR NOT NEEDED FOR THE PROCESS.  THE STATION WAS OUT OF SERVICE FOR APPROXIMATELY 6 WEEKS IN AN EFFORT TO IDENTIFY AND REPAIR AREAS OF CONCERN.  IT WAS RECOGNIZED THAT ADDITIONAL DEAD HEADS EXISTED IN THE STATION AND A PROJECT WAS PLANNED FOR 2016 TO INVESTIGATE OTHER POTENTIAL DEAD HEADS FOR INTERNAL CORROSION.  THE 2016 PROJECT WAS DELAYED TO COINCIDE WITH A COMPREHENSIVE PLANNED MECHANICAL INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT OF THE STATION VESSELS AND BELOW GROUND PIPING IN 2017.      WILLIAMS' PROCEDURE 20.11.05 LIQUID, SOLID AND SLUDGE SAMPLING AND TESTING, AND WILSOP PROCEDURE 20.11.02 INTERNAL CORROSION MONITORING PROVIDES LANGUAGE REQUIRING AN INTERNAL CORROSION MONITORING PROGRAM FOR TWO-PHASE AND/OR WET GAS GATHERING PIPELINES.  IN THIS AREA THERE WAS NOT AN INTERNAL CORROSION MONITORING SYSTEM IN PLACE.  ALTHOUGH THE GATHERING SYSTEM FEEDING STATION 535 IS OPERATED BY OTHERS, A LOGICAL EXTENSION OF THE POLICY TO STATION 535 WOULD HAVE BEEN IN ORDER.    WHEN INTERNAL CORROSION WAS FOUND DURING THE 2015 LEAK, WILLIAMS REMOVED PIPE UNTIL GOOD PIPE WAS FOUND.  FIELD PERSONNEL BELIEVED THEY WERE FULFILLING SECTION 3. OF  WILSOP PROCEDURE 20.11.01 WHICH INDICATES ""INVESTIGATE THE ADJACENT PIPE IF EVIDENCE OF CORROSION IS FOUND, TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE INTERNAL CORROSION"".  AN INTERNAL CORROSION THREAT ASSESSMENT WAS ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2016, IN ACCORDANCE WITH WILSOP 20.11.01, 4.3.  THE INTERPRETATION OF THE SUBJECT POLICY AT THE TIME LED TO THE ASSERTION THAT THE ISSUANCE OF THE THREAT ASSESSMENT WITHIN A ONE YEAR TIME FRAME WAS COMPLIANT WITH WILSOP 20.11.01, 4.4.  A BROADER INTERPRETATION OF THE PROCEDURE WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THAT BOTH THE THREAT ASSESSMENT AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS SET FORTH IN THE THREAT ASSESSMENT BE PERFORMED WITHIN THE ONE YEAR TIME FRAME.  THIS WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN EXAMINATION OF THE PORTION OF THE PIPELINE WHICH RUPTURED."

MARY PARRISH, IN THE STATE OF LOUISIANA. THE LOCATION OF THESE BUBBLES WERE EMANATING IN THE PROXIMITY OF COLUMBIA'S LINE EL-100 AS WELL AS OTHER PIPELINE OPERATORS IN THE REGION. DUE TO THE VARIOUS CROSSING OF PIPELINES ALONG THE RIVER, THE INITIAL ASSUMPTION WAS THAT THE SOURCE OF THESES BUBBLES OF UNINTENDED RELEASE WAS FROM ANOTHER PIPELINE OPERATOR OTHER THAN COLUMBIA. COLUMBIA OPERATES AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF PIPELINES IN THE AREA. HOWEVER, IT WAS IDENTIFIED THAT THESE RIVER CROSSINGS WERE ABANDONED BACK IN THE EARLY 80'S AND WERE KEPT IN IDLE STATUS WITH ABOUT 32 PSIG BLANKET PRESSURE. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER OPERATORS WHO DO HAVE PIPELINES CROSSING THE RIVER, IT WAS RULED OUT THAT THEIR PIPELINES WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THIS RELEASE. HENCE, COLUMBIA IDENTIFIED THAT THESE BUBBLES WERE EMANATING FROM COLUMBIA'S LINE EL-100. THEREAFTER, THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) WAS NOTIFIED. THE REPORT TO THE NRC WAS MADE DUE TO THE EXPECTED COST TO ABANDON AND REMOVE LINE EL-100 SECTIONS OF PIPELINE CROSSING THE WAX LAKE OUTLET WOULD EXCEED $50,000. THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF MATERIAL DID NOT EXCEED 3,000 MCF. PLANS WERE SET FORTH TO ABANDON AND REMOVE THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE IN A TIMELY MANNER.  AFTER REMOVING THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE EL-100 FROM THE RIVER, AN ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO THE FAILED SECTION OF LINE EL-100 BY A METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS CONSULTANT.  THE ASSESSMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE FAILED SECTION WAS LIKELY SUBJECT TO LONGITUDINAL AND BENDING STRESSES IN CONJUNCTION WITH WALL LOSS DUE TO EXTERNAL CORROSION AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.

COLUMBIA PERSONNEL INSPECTED THE FACILITY AND SECURED OTHER VALVES UNTIL FURTHER INVESTIGATION STARTS.    COLUMBIA ENGINEERING SERVICES INVESTIGATED THE EVENT AND PRELIMINARY CAUSAL ANALYSIS INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THE 4 INCH BLOWDOWN VALVE FAILED TO REMAIN SHUT DUE TO A FAULTY ACTUATOR ON THIS VALVE.  HENCE, RELEASING MATERIAL INTO ATMOSPHERE.  THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL RELEASED INTO ATMOSPHERE WAS CALCULATED TO BE 3,083 MCF.  THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER.  THE INVESTIGATION TEAM CONDUCTED A THOROUGH ANALYSIS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE REASON(S) BEHIND THE UNINTENDED ACTIVATION OF THE BLOWDOWN VALVE AND FOUND THAT THE VALVE'S ACTUATOR HAD A FAULTY SIGNAL THAT MAY HAVE INITIATED THE UNINTENDED SIGNAL TO OPEN THE VALVE AND START THE ESD SEQUENCE.  SEVERAL COMPONENTS WERE REPLACED INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE RELIEF VALVE, THE REGULATOR (FOR THE POWER GAS SYSTEM) AND A RESETTING TO THE RELIEF VALVE'S SET-POINT TOO.

TO ISOLATE THE LINE TO BE WORKED ON, THE PILOT GAS LINES BETWEEN THE  PILOT ISOLATION VALVE AND PILOT GAS SOLENOID WERE REQUIRED TO BE VENTED. IN ORDER TO PERFORM THIS TASK, THE FIREGATE VENT VALVES NEEDED TO BE IMMOBILIZED, TO PREVENT THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF GAS. THE NORMAL PROCEDURE TO COMPLETE THIS TASK IS TO ISOLATE THE LOCAL POWER GAS AT THE ACTUATOR, AND VENT THE LINE BETWEEN THE ISOLATION VALVE AND THE ACTUATOR, THEN ISOLATE THE PILOT GAS AT THE ACTUATOR, AND VENT THE LINE BETWEEN THE ISOLATION VALVE AND THE ACTUATOR. ALL POWER GAS LINES AND PILOT GAS LINES TO THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN VALVE ACTUATORS WERE ISOLATED, AND THE CREW BEGAN TO VENT THE PILOT LINES ON TWO OF THE VALVES, VALVE 612 AND VALVE 614. THIS RESULTED (AS DESIGNED) IN TWO FIREGATE VALVES (612 AND 614) TRAVELING TO 100% OPEN AND VENTING 3.484 MMCF OF NATURAL GAS FROM A 620 PSI LINE TO ATMOSPHERE THROUGH THE 16-FOOT VENT STACK, FROM 0816 HOURS TO 0825 HOURS. THE OPENED VALVES WERE MANUALLY CLOSED BY STATION PERSONNEL. AFTER RE-ASSESSMENT OF THE PROCEDURE AND SITUATION, STATION PERSONNEL RELIEVED PRESSURE OFF OF THE POWER GAS BETWEEN THE ISOLATION VALVE AND FIREGATE VENT VALVE ACTUATORS, AND THEN RELIEVED PRESSURE OFF THE PILOT GAS.    THE REQUIRED SEQUENCE TO ISOLATE FIREGATE VALVES IS TO ISOLATE POWER GAS AND THEN PILOT GAS. THIS SEQUENCE WAS NOT OUTLINED IN THE PROCEDURE PROVIDED. A DETAILED REVIEW OF THE PROCEDURE WAS NOT COMPLETED BY ADDITIONAL ENGINEERING REPRESENTATION FROM GAS COMPRESSION OPERATIONS, AND A PHYSICAL WALK-DOWN OF THE EQUIPMENT WAS NOT PERFORMED BY THE SITE FIELD LEADER, PRINCIPAL FIELD LEADER, OR BY ASSIGNED CREW PRIOR TO PROCEDURE APPROVAL OR WORK PERFORMANCE."

BYPASS MODE PREVENTS THE EMERGENCY SYSTEM FROM PERFORMING A BUILDING SHUTDOWN OR AN EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN WHILE THE TECHNICIANS WORK ON THE GAS DETECTION SYSTEMS. WHILE THE EMPLOYEE WAS TESTING THE FIRE AND GAS DETECTION SYSTEM ON UNIT 2, THE DISPLAY SHOWED ALARMS FOR GAS DETECTION ON UNIT 1 WHICH WAS UNEXPECTED. SHORTLY AFTER SEEING THE VISUAL ALARM, THE EMPLOYEE HEARD THE VENTING OF GAS OCCURRING OUTSIDE THE BUILDING, WHICH WAS NOT EXPECTED, AND ASSUMED AN EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN HAS COMMENCED. THIS INITIAL VENTING WAS CAUSED BY AN ERROR IN THE BYPASS MODE'S CODE, WHICH FAILED TO PREVENT THE VENTING OF GAS WHEN THE GAS DETECTION HEAD ON THE UNITS DETECTED GAS.

FOLLOWING THE ARRIVAL AND INVESTIGATION OF THE SITE, THE TECHNICIAN CONCLUDED THAT DEAD VEGETATION AND ELEVATED LEVELS OF METHANE, AS MEASURED BY A GAS DETECTOR, IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPELINE WAS LIKELY DUE TO A GAS RELEASE.  THE SUSPECTED  GAS RELEASE PROMPTED A CALL TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AND AN INCIDENT REPORT (NRC #1152118) WAS FILED AT 15:23 ET ON 30 JUNE 2016. THE SECTION OF PIPE WAS ISOLATED AND THE PRESSURE REDUCED TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.    FOLLOWING EXCAVATION OF THE LOCATION, A GIRTHWELD FEATURE WAS DISCOVERED AND PRESUMED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE GAS RELEASE.  A 14 FOOT SECTION INCLUDING THE GIRTH WELD WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH NEW PIPE. THE PIPE SECTION CONTAINING THE GIRTH WELD WAS SUBMITTED TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS.    THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON 31 AUGUST 2016 AT 13:30 LOCAL TIME.    LABORATORY ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT LEAKING FLAW WAS A CONSEQUENCE OF AN INCOMPLETE FUSION ALONG THE ROOT PASS COUPLED WITH POROSITY IN FILL AND CAP FILL PASSES DURING INITIAL FABRICATION. THE INCOMPLETE FUSION AND POROSITY, IN COMBINATION, RESULTED IN AN AREA WHERE THE LOCAL TENSILE CAPACITY WAS LIMITED. DUE TO THE LIMITED BONDING BETWEEN THE WELD SURFACES, MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN THE TEMPERATURE DURING OPERATIONS CREATED TENSILE STRESSES THAT CONTRIBUTED EXTENSION OF THE WELD IMPERFECTION."

LINE E-LOOP IS A TRANSMISSION PIPELINE THAT IS OWNED, OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA).  THE PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 750 PSIG WITH 1,000 PSIG BEING ITS MAOP, PIPELINE DIAMETER IS 20-INCHES WITH 0.375-INCH WALL THICKNESS, AND ITS GRADE IS X45.   THERE WERE NO REPORTED FATALITIES, INJURIES OR ANY NEARBY ROADS THAT WERE SHUT DOWN.  FURTHERMORE, THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS (MATERIAL) DID NOT IGNITE.  INITIAL INFORMATION INDICATED THAT THE LINE WHERE THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE IS A CLASS 1 LOCATION SOUTH OF EDEN RIDGE ROAD NEAR THE TOWN OF FOSTER IN BRACKEN COUNTY, KY.    COLUMBIA OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WHO RESPONDED TO THE INCIDENT AREA WENT TO THE NEAREST CRITICAL VALVES AND OPERATED THEM TO ISOLATE THE AFFECTED SEGMENT OF LINE E-LOOP.  THE TWO CRITICAL VALVES WERE FULLY CLOSED AT 12:08 PM AND 12:11 PM RESPECTIVELY PREVENTING ADDITIONAL RELEASE OF MATERIAL INTO ATMOSPHERE.  THEREAFTER, THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE AND INVESTIGATION INTO THE INCIDENT WAS INITIATED AFTER THE AREA WAS FULLY SECURED. A PRE-TESTED PIPE JOINTS WITH THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTICS 20-IN DIAMETER WITH 0.375-IN WT, GRADE X-65, TESTED TO A CLASS 3 LOCATION TEST PRESSURE WAS INSTALLED AND REPLACED THE DAMAGED SECTION.  THE TIE-IN WELDS WERE NON-DESTRUCTIVELY EXAMINED (NDE).  AFTER CONFIRMING THAT THE NDE RESULTS HAD NO ABNORMAL INDICATIONS AND THAT ALL WELDS WERE WITHIN CODE REQUIREMENTS, THE LINE WAS RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE.  AN INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY THE CONTRACTOR, CONCLUDED THAT ADDITIONAL SAFETY MEASURES HAVE TO BE ADDED TO THEIR PRACTICE AND EVALUATED ACTIONS WITH THEIR PERSONNEL TO PREVENT EVENTS SIMILAR FROM OCCURRING ON OTHER WORK LOCATION."

AFTER THE VERTICAL VALVES WERE FULLY CLOSED, THE MATERIAL STOPPED VENTING INTO ATMOSPHERE.  AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE, A NEARBY SHOP AND A BANK WERE TEMPORARILY EVACUATED. THE OCCUPANTS WERE CLEARED TO RETURN TO THEIR BUSINESSES AFTER THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE. AFTER IDENTIFYING THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THIS UNINTENDED RELEASE (THE STOPPLE PLUG), THE STOPPLE WAS CUT AND REMOVED BY THE CONTRACTOR FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.  THEREAFTER, A PRE-TESTED SECTION OF PIPE WAS INSTALLED, WELDED AND NON-DESTRUCTIVELY TESTED, AFTER WHICH THE LINE WAS RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE ON APRIL 15, 2016, AT 03:00.

THE SITE WAS EXCAVATED ON MARCH 17, 2016 AND THE LEAK WAS VALIDATED. THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED SECTION OF PIPE ON MARCH 19, 2016 AND THE LINE RESTORED TO SERVICE.    THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS ANALYZED INTERNALLY DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL SIMILARITIES FROM A RECENTLY REPORTED FAILURE, WHICH WAS SENT TO A 3RD PARTY LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE INTERNAL ANALYSIS, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THIS FAILURE ARE IDENTICAL. THE PREVIOUS FAILURE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD OF THE PIPE WALL AT THE WELD TOE. THE PRIMARY FACTOR TO THE FAILURE WAS SETTLEMENT OF THE BRANCH CONNECTION DUE TO IMPROPER SUPPORT. THE SETTLEMENT CAUSED BENDING STRESSES IN THE CARRIER PIPE AT THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT FILLET WELD WHICH RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF A CRACK. THE GEOMETRY OF THE FILLET WELD THAT ATTACHED THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT PAD TO THE CARRIER PIPE WAS ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE. THE SADDLE THICKNESS WAS 2.5 TIMES THE THICKNESS OF THE CARRIER PIPE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A STRESS CONCENTRATION IN THE THINNER PIPE AT THE FILLET WELD TOE. UNDERCUT AT THE TOE OF THE FILLET WELD FURTHER CONCENTRATED THE STRESS AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FORMATION OF A CRACK."

PERSON ON CALL CALLED A SECOND EMPLOYEE TO ASSIST WITH INVESTIGATION, DROVE TO STATION TO PICK UP A GAS DETECTOR AND SECOND EMPLOYEE, AND DROVE OVER TO THE SITE IN QUESTION. AFTER ARRIVING THE TWO EMPLOYEES BEGAN SCANNING THE RIGHT OF WAY AND DISCOVERED BUBBLES WITHIN THE RIGHT OF WAY LIMITS. AT THIS TIME THE LEAD RIGHT OF WAY EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SITE AND BEGAN THE PROCESS OF ELIMINATING POTENTIAL FOREIGN LINE CROSSINGS BEING THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  RIGHT OF WAY LEAD CALLED DISTRICT MANAGER AND REPORTED HIS FINDINGS OF NO KNOWN FOREIGN LINE CROSSINGS AND HE WAS PICKING UP A SMALL GAS LEAK LOCATED ABOVE THE MAIN LINE C PIPE. DISTRICT MANAGER BEGAN MAKING CALLS TO PIPELINE CONTROL, CYPRESS DIVISION DIRECTOR, AND THE CYPRESS DIVISION MANAGER ENGINEERING WHO ASSISTED BY PIPELINE SAFETY. PIPELINE CONTROL CALLED AND REPORTED THE POSSIBLE LEAK TO THE NRC AND THE LOUISIANA STATE POLICE.             DISTRICT MANAGER INSTRUCTED RIGHT OF WAY LEAD TO ISOLATE THE C LINE PIPING SECTION BETWEEN THE 50C50 AND 50C60 AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE AND TO CONTINUE TO VERIFY IF THE LEAK WAS IN FACT COMING FROM OUR LINE.  AFTER ISOLATION THE STATION CREW MEMBERS INSTALLED GAUGES AT THE 50C50 AND 50C60 AND BEGAN TO MONITOR FOR ANY LOSS IN PRESSURE ON THE C LINE SECTION. OTHER CREW MEMBERS CONTINUED TO INVESTIGATE RECORDS FOR ANY FOREIGN LINE CROSSINGS AND CONTINUED UPDATING PIPELINE CONTROL AND CYPRESS DIVISION.              AFTER MONITORING PRESSURES FOR A PERIOD OF TIME SHOWED NO DROP IN PRESSURE THE DISTRICT MANAGER DISCUSSED WITH THE DIVISION DIRECTOR THE NEED TO BLOW DOWN THE C LINE SECTION TO VERIFY THAT THE LEAK WAS EMANATING FROM THIS SECTION OF LINE. DIRECTOR AGREED, SAFE BLOW DOWN PROCEDURES WERE DISCUSSED WITH THE STATION CREW, AND THE 50C50 TO 50C60 LINE SECTION WAS BLOWN DOWN.            DISTRICT MANAGER AND DIVISION SAFETY EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT LEAK SITE WITH APPROX. 100 PSI REMAINING ON THE LINE SECTION. AT THIS TIME THE BUBBLES WERE VERIFIED TO HAVE STOPPED. STATION EMPLOYEES CONTINUED BLOW DOWN TO 0 PSI, SECURED ALL VALVES AND SITES, AND BEGAN SCHEDULING FOR INVESTIGATORY DIGS TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.           ***UPDATE PER SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 5/16/2016***        METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE LEAKING SECTION OF PIPE WAS MANUFACTURED WITH AN AREA OF VARYING HARDNESS. RCA INDICATES THAT THIS AREA OF PARTICULARLY HARDER STEEL WAS THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE CRACK FORMATION. THE INSPECTION OF AFFECTED PIPE SAMPLE WAS COMPLETED BY ANDERSON AND ASSOCIATES IN HOUSTON ON 4/15/16.  INSPECTIONS INDICATED ONLY THIS LOCALIZED AREA BECAME SUSCEPTIBLE TO EITHER HYDROGEN EMBRITTLEMENT OR HIGH PH SCC MECHANISMS; WITHOUT THE HARD SPOT, THE LAB SAID THERE IS NO EVIDENCE CRACKING WOULD HAVE OCCURRED. UPON REVIEW OF THE 2013 ILI, TWO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION DIGS WILL BE CONDUCTED IN 2016 TO SEARCH FOR ADDITIONAL AREAS OF ELEVATED HARDNESS. ONCE THESE TWO DIGS ARE EITHER REPAIRED OR CLEARED WITH REGARD TO HARD SPOTS, MAIN LINE 'C' FROM 50C41 TO 50C60 CAN BE CONSIDERED AT VERY LOW RISK FOR CRACKING SUSCEPTIBILITY DUE TO HARD SPOTS.     ***UPDATE PER SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT 12/1/2016***    THE TWO ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION DIGS REFERENCED ABOVE CAME BACK NEGATIVE FOR INDICATIONS OF THE SAME DEFECT THAT APPARENTLY CAUSED THIS INCIDENT. THE INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN CONCLUDED WITH NO FURTHER ACTION DEEMED NECESSARY."

OUTLET AT THE COOLIDGE CITY GATE.  THE COOLIDGE CITY GATE IS LOCATED AT 4600 COOLIDGE HWY., (OAKLAND COUNTY) ROYAL OAK, MICHIGAN.      AN INSTRUMENT MECHANIC (IM) WAS DISPATCHED AT APPROXIMATELY 04:52 AND ARRIVED ON LOCATION AT APPROXIMATELY 05:53 TO DISCOVER A FAILURE OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR (P2).   THE REGULATOR FAILURE CAUSED THE RELIEF VALVE (RV- 6) SERVING THE ADAMS RD., OUTLET TO ACTIVATE AND REMAIN OPEN UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 06:18.  THE RESPONDING IM PERFORMED A VALVING OPERATION TO ISOLATE THE FAILED REGULATOR ALLOWING THE STANDBY REGULATOR (S2) TO FEED. THE PRESSURE ON THE ADAMS RD. OUTLET INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM OF 318.37 PSIG AND APPROXIMATELY 4.2 MMCF OF NATURAL GAS WAS VENTED TO THE ATMOSPHERE AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.    THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION OF THE FAILURE SUGGESTED THE INLET SCREEN ON THE ADAMS RD. OUTLET MAIN RUN REGULATOR (P2) WAS PARTIALLY DISINTEGRATED CAUSING METAL DEBRIS TO CONTAMINATE THE REGULATORS INTERNAL COMPONENTS CAUSING IT TO FAIL OPEN.    THE P2 REGULATOR WAS CLEANED OF DEBRIS AND THE INLET SCREEN AND REGULATOR DIAPHRAGM WERE REPLACED.  THE EQUIPMENT WAS TESTED AND RETURN TO SERVICE.  THE IMPACTED RELIEF VALVE WAS ALSO DISASSEMBLE AND CHECKED FOR DAMAGE AND DEBRIS WITH NEGATIVE RESULTS.    AT APPROXIMATELY 04:42 THE FOLLOWING DAY THE P2 REGULATOR EXPERIENCED ANOTHER FAILURE.  THE RELIEF VALVE OPERATED AS A RESULT OF THE EXCEEDANCE.  HOWEVER, HYDRATES ENTRAINED IN THE GAS STREAM WERE FOUND TO HAVE PRECIPITATED OUT AND FROZE IN THE RELIEF VALVE'S PILOT RESULTING IN DELAYED ACTIVATION.  THE PRESSURE ON THE ADAMS RD. OUTLET INCREASED TO A MAXIMUM OF 338 PSIG FOR APPROXIMATELY TWO MINUTES BEFORE RETURNING TO A STEADY RELIEF PRESSURE BELOW 110% OF MAOP. THE RELIEF VALVE WAS CLEANED, REBUILT, INSPECTED AND RETURN TO SERVICE.  REGULATOR P2 HAS BEEN REMOVED FROM SERVICE UNTIL FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND LAB ANALYSIS IS COMPLETE AND APPROPRIATE REMEDIATION ACTIONS IDENTIFIED.  A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT DETAILING THE FAILURE THAT OCCURRED ON FEBRUARY 11TH WAS REPORTED TO PHMSA ON FEBRUARY 18, 2016 (SCRC 20160022).    A MOBILE AND WALKING SURVEY WAS PERFORMED ON APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES OF 12"" STEEL HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION PIPING (300 PSIG MAOP) OPERATING AT > 20% SMYS AND ASSOCIATED SERVICE LINES BETWEEN THE COOLIDGE CITY GATE AND MAPLE RD., TROY, MICHIGAN AND NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.    THE REGULATION EQUIPMENT (REGULATOR P2) REMOVED FROM SERVICE ON FEBRUARY 11, 2016 WAS REPLACED WITH A MOONEY FLOWGRID REGULATOR ON AUGUST 8, 2016 AND RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATIONS.    THE REGULATOR, DIAPHRAGM AND CAGE WERE EXAMINED BY CONSUMERS ENERGY LABORATORY SERVICES, IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE INVESTIGATION FOUND THE DIAPHRAGM DIMENSIONS WERE INCONSISTENT WITH THE DIMENSIONS OF THE CAGE, PREVENTING A SECURE FIT DURING ASSEMBLY. IN ADDITION, MEASUREMENT DATA INDICATED THE O-RING ASSEMBLED ON THE BONNET WAS NOT SUBJECT TO COMPRESSION DURING ASSEMBLY. THE INVESTIGATION WAS INCONCLUSIVE AS TO WHY THE DIAPHRAGM WAS OUT OF POSITION, AND NO FAILURE CAUSE WAS IDENTIFIED.    A SAFETY-RELATED CONDITION REPORT ""RETURN TO SERVICE"" NOTICE DETAILING REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WAS SUBMITTED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2017."

UPON COMPLETING THE TASK AND DEPARTING THE AREA VIA BOAT, IT WAS NOTED THAT A FEW BUBBLES WERE EMANATING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE MARSHLAND.  NOTING THAT COLUMBIA HAS A PIPELINE FACILITY NEARBY, COLUMBIA PERSONNEL STOPPED AND STARTED INVESTIGATING.  GAS SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE IDENTIFIED BUBBLES LOCATION AND FROM THE CLOSEST MEASURING STATION.  THE TWO SAMPLES WERE SENT TO THE LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE DISCOVERED RELEASE WAS FROM A COLUMBIA PIPELINE OR OTHER OPERATORS IN THE AREA.  MEANWHILE, COLUMBIA OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THE CLOSEST CRITICAL VALVES TO REDUCE THE PRESSURE FROM THE VALVES' OPERATING VALUE OF 800 PSIG DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 200 PSIG.  AFTER THE RESULTS WERE RECEIVED FROM THE LABORATORY, IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT THE VISIBLE BUBBLES WERE EMANATING FROM A COLUMBIA PIPELINE.  ACCORDINGLY, A CONTRACTOR WAS ASSIGNED TO EXCAVATE AND COMPLETE THE NECESSARY REPAIR WHICH WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE FROM A PINHOLE LEAK IN A GIRTH WELD.  A LEAK CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND THE PIPELINE OPERATING PRESSURE WAS RAISED TO ITS NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2016.  KEY LESSONS LEARNED FROM THIS INCIDENT WERE THAT  MAINTENANCE PIGGING ARE RECOMMENDED TO BE PERFORMED ON MORE ROUTINE SCHEDULED BASIS TO REMOVE TRAPPED LIQUIDS DUE TO LOW FLOW IN PIPELINE. ALSO TO PERFORM MAINTENANCE BATCH TREATMENT ON MORE ROUTINE SCHEDULED BASIS DUE TO LIQUID AND LOW FLOW CONDITIONS."

AT 09:58 SSC GAS CONTROL NOTIFIED PSAP THAT A RELIEF VALVE HAD BEEN GOING OFF IN THE AREA BUT HAD BEEN CONFIRMED TO HAVE STOPPED.  SSC GAS CONTROL NOTIFIED SSC OPERATIONS AT 09:58 TO TRAVEL TO THE SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ISSUE.  SSC OPERATIONS ARRIVED ON SITE AT 12:12, AFTER INITIAL TESTING THE RELIEF VALVE ACTIVATED DURING TEST AT SET PRESSURE AND RESEATED PROPERLY.  NO ISSUES WERE FOUND WITH THE RELIEF VALVE.  SSC GAS CONTROL REVIEWED FLOWS OF THE SETTING AND IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE METER BEGAN SHOWING NO FLOW AT APPROXIMATELY 15:00 ON 12/10/15.  BEFORE THAT POINT THE METER WAS RECEIVING BETWEEN 5-6 MMCF/DAY RATE.  AFTER DISCUSSING THIS WITH SUPERIOR CASHION, THEY STATED THEY HAD NOT SHUT DOWN THEIR FLOWS.  AT THE TIME WHEN THE FLOW WENT TO 0 THE PRESSURE ON THE SEGMENT WAS AT 360 PSIG, 53 POUNDS UNDER MAOP, AND THEN DROPPED AND SETTLED AT 343 PSIG.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE BEGAN RELIEVING AT 14:50 ON 12/10/2015 AND CONTINUED TO BLOW UNTIL THE NEXT MORNING WHEN SSC RECEIVED A CALL.  THE PRESSURE SHOWED A STABILIZATION BECAUSE THERE IS A CHECK VALVE BETWEEN THE RELIEF AND THE METER SETTING AND THE CLOSURE OF THIS VALVE TO PREVENT BLOWING DOWN THE SSC MAINLINE WOULD CAUSE THE METER SETTING TO MEASURE THE SAME PRESSURE AS THE MAINLINE WITH 0 FLOW.  SSC CONTACTED THE CUSTOMER AND DETERMINED THERE WAS A PERIOD WHEN THEY HAD DELIVERED HIGHER PRESSURE GAS.  ONCE THE HIGH PRESSURE GAS SLUG REACHED THE RELIEF VALVE IT ACTIVATED.  THE RELIEF VALVE ACTIVATED AS INTENDED, BUT SSC WAS NOT ABLE TO SEE THE GAS RELEASE DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE CHECK VALVE.  BECAUSE THE CUSTOMER HAD REACHED NOMINATION FOR THE DAY GAS CONTROL DID NOT SEE ANY ISSUE WITH THE METER READING 0 FLOW (NO FLOW).  SSC HAS INSTALLED A NEW TRANSMITTER FOR THE METER SETTING UPSTREAM OF THE RELIEF VALVE TO DETERMINE A DIFFERENCE IN PRESSURE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CHECK VALVE IF CLOSED AND AID IN THE NOTIFICATION OF RELIEVING GAS IN THE FUTURE."

PARKS	DIRECTOR	(713)386-3404	jparks@cpg.com	"ON NOVEMBER 23, 2015, A COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA) FACILITY WAS SUBJECT TO AN EVENT THAT INVOLVED AN UNINTENDED ACTIVATION OF AN 8-IN BLOW-OFF (BO) VALVE.  THIS BO VALVE IS LOCATED IN RIPLEY COMPRESSOR STATION (CS) YARD.  RIPLEY CS IS A TRANSMISSION FACILITY LOCATED NEAR THE TOWN OF SANDYVILLE, JACKSON COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA IS OWNED, OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY COLUMBIA.    COLUMBIA OPERATIONS PERSONNEL RESPONDED TO THIS EVENT AND ISOLATED THE BO VALVE WITH ITS RESPECTIVE PIPELINE PREVENTING ADDITIONAL UNINTENDED RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS (MATERIAL) INTO ATMOSPHERE.  THERE WAS NO PRESENCE OF FIRE, EXPLOSION OR EVACUATIONS IN LIEU OF THE MATERIAL RELEASE.  THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT INDICATED THAT PRESENCE OF ACCUMULATED MOISTURE PLAYED A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR IN THE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS INCIDENT.  THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) SYSTEM TRIGGER PNEUMATIC PRESSURE ON THAT ACTUATOR BLED DOWN BELOW THE REQUIRED PRESSURE TO HOLD THE VALVE CLOSED.  THE ESD PNEUMATIC PRESSURE TO ALL OTHER ESD VALVES REMAINED AT ITS FULL SYSTEM PRESSURE. AN ACCUMULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 2 GALLONS OF ACCUMULATED MOISTURE WAS DRAINED FROM THE ESD TRIGGER PNEUMATIC SUPPLY TANK, THAT IS LOCATED DIRECTLY DOWNSTREAM OF THE FACILITY'S AIR DRYER SYSTEM.  A VENDOR TECHNICIAN WAS ON SITE THE FOLLOWING DAY OF THE INCIDENT WHERE A FULL ASSESSMENT TO THE AIR DRYER FOLLOWED.  THE VENDOR'S TECHNICIAN IDENTIFIED THAT THE AIR DRYER SYSTEM'S AUTOMATIC CONTROL SYSTEM WAS LOCKED-UP.   A MANUAL SWITCHING OPERATION WAS PERFORMED TO ENABLE THE FULL OPERATION OF THE TWO AIR DRYER SYSTEM TOWERS.    THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA) REPORT CONCLUDED THAT MOISTURE COLLECTED IN THE ESD TRIGGER PNEUMATIC TUBING FROZE WHICH ALLOWED THE PRESSURE ON THE ESD POPPET VALVE TO DECREASE TO THE POINT THAT THE VALVE TRIPPED AND THE BO VALVE OPENED. THE SOURCE OF MOISTURE WAS MOST LIKELY FROM THE ESD TRIGGER PNEUMATIC SUPPLY UNIT. ACCUMULATED MOISTURE WAS DISCOVERED IN THE ESD AIR STORAGE TANK. EVENTUALLY, THE CS AIR DRYER ALLOWED THE DEW POINT OF THE COMPRESSED AIR TO INCREASE. WHEN THE AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE DROPPED BELOW THE DEW POINT OF THE COMPRESSED AIR, THE WATER VAPOR CONDENSED IN THE ESD STORAGE TANK AND THE TRIGGER AIR PIPING.  RECOMMENDATIONS: 1) COMPRESSOR STATIONS THAT USE A PNEUMATIC SYSTEM IN THEIR ESD SYSTEMS ARE RECOMMENDED TO CONSIDER INSTALLING A DEW POINT ANALYZER AT THE OUTLET OF THE AIR DRYER TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE AN ALARM OUTPUT TO THE CS CONTROLLER SO APPROPRIATE ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN.  2) CONSIDER ADDING IN COLUMBIA'S WORK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (WMS) A PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE (PM) TASK TO THE ESD SYSTEM TO PERFORM AN ANNUAL PURGE TO THE PNEUMATIC SYSTEM AND VERIFY IF PRESENCE OF MOISTURE WAS IDENTIFIED.  ALSO, CONSIDER THE ADDITION OF ANOTHER PM TO THE CRITICAL SHAFER ACTUATOR INSTALLATIONS TO INSPECT ROUTINELY THE SEALS FOR EVIDENCE OF DETERIORATION.  SITE SPECIFIC: PER THE PROVIDED RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE RCA REPORT, A DEW POINT ANALYZER WITH CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK AND ALARM OUTPUT WAS INSTALLED WITH THE ADDITION OF THE APPROPRIATE PMS IN THE WMS."

SINCE THIS EXCEEDS THE REPORTING CRITERIA OF 3 MILLION FT3 LISTED IN 49 CFR191.3 A ONE HOUR CALL WAS MADE TO THE NRC AND A FOLLOW UP CALL WAS MADE TO THE ICC.      THE CALL TO THE NRC WAS DELAYED BECAUSE THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT MADE BY MANLOVE PERSONNEL WAS THAT THIS EVENT DID NOT MEET THE DEFINITION CONTAINED IN 49CFR191.3.  PERSONNEL AT MANLOVE ORIGINALLY BELIEVED THAT THE DEFINITION LIMITED REPORTABLE RELEASES TO LEAKS IN THE SYSTEM.  SINCE THIS VALVE IS AN IDENTIFIED RELEASE PATH, THEY INITIALLY DETERMINED IT WAS NOT REPORTABLE.

THE GAS IGNITED RESULTING IN ONE FATALITY AND TWO INJURIES.  WITHIN 4 MINUTES OF IDENTIFYING THE LOSS IN PRESSURE ON L-300A, GAS CONTROL INITIATED REMOTE SHUT OFF OF TWO MAINLINE VALVES AND ISOLATED THE PIPELINE BY 1547 HOURS.  PG&E'S FIRST RESPONDERS ARRIVED ON-SITE AT 1604 HOURS AND MANUALLY SHUT OFF VALVES V-267.26A AND V-278.70A TO ISOLATE A SMALLER SECTION OF PIPELINE.  THE REMAINING GAS WITHIN THE PIPELINE BURNED UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 1630 HOURS. THE VALVE CLOSEST TO THE INCIDENT, VALVE-270.85, WAS CLOSED AT 1700 HOURS ONCE THE FIRE WAS OUT AND THE EQUIPMENT WAS COOL ENOUGH TO OPERATE.  THE EXCAVATOR DID NOT HOLD A VALID USA TICKET.  FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENT WERE ON-SITE, AND BLOCKED OFF THE AREA.  APPROXIMATELY NINETY GAS CUSTOMERS LOST SERVICE AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT.  MAJORITY OF THE GAS SERVICES WERE RESTORED BY 11/14/15 AT 1500 HOURS.  THERE WERE SIX TO SEVEN REMAINING CUSTOMERS THAT WERE EITHER VACANT OR OUT-OF-TOWN.  SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE OUT-OF-TOWN CUSTOMERS WITHIN A WEEK FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT. A NEARBY HOME AND BARN ALSO SUSTAINED DAMAGES FROM THE FIRE.  REPAIRS TO THE PIPE WERE COMPLETED ON 11/20/15 AT NOON, X-RAYS WERE COMPLETED BY 1330 HOURS, AND THE LINE WAS PUT BACK TO NORMAL OPERATION AT 1645 HOURS.  DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE INCIDENT ARE APPROXIMATELY $2.5 MILLION AND VOLUME OF GAS UNINTENTIONALLY RELEASED IS 67 MMCF.  MEDIA WAS REPORTED ON-SITE.

LATERAL 60 WEST IS A 6 INCH PIPELINE (APPROXIMATELY 11/2 MILES LONG) LOCATED IN CONSUMERS ENERGY'S CRANBERRY STORAGE FIELD, MARION, MICHIGAN (MISSAUKEE COUNTY)     THE GSM IMPLEMENTED THE STANDARD PRECAUTIONARY LOCK OUT TAG OUT PROCESS, ISOLATING AND SHUTTING DOWN LATERAL 60 WEST AND BARRICADED THE LOCATION UNTIL FURTHER INVESTIGATION COULD BE PERFORMED.  THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT DOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 12:31.    ON TUEDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 2015 A 4 FOOT SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS CUT OUT AND A OVAL HOLE APPROXIMATELY .25 X .50 WAS DISCOVERED.  THE LEAK WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED CORROSION AS A POSSIBLE LEAK SOURCE.    THE GAS LOSS  CALCULATION WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION:   LATERAL 60 WEST WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON OCTOBER 7, 2015.  THE LEAK WAS IDENTIFIED AND THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED AND SHUT DOWN ON OCTOBER 24, 2015 APPROXIMATELY 36 MINUTES FOLLOWING NOTIFICATION.  A VISUAL INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED BY OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WHEN THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE, HOWEVER NO ADDITIONAL INSPECTIONS/PATROLS WERE CONDUCTED.  BECAUSE NO ADDITIONAL LEAK INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED DURING THIS PERIOD,  CONSUMERS ENERGY OPTED TO  CALCULATE THE HOURS FROM THE DATE THE LINE WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE ON OCTOBER 7TH UNTIL THE LEAK WAS DISCOVERED AND THE LATERAL SHUT-DOWN RESULTING IN A GAS LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY 37MMCF.  THE GAS LOSS CALCULATION BASED ON NOTIFICATION AND ISOLATION AND SHUT DOWN WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A GAS LOSS CALCULATION OF LESS THAN 1MMCF.    THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE CONSUMERS ENERGY TRAIL STREET LABORATORY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION.  LABORATORY ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE LEAK WAS A RESULT OF A LOCALIZED CORROSION PIT ON THE PIPE ID.  THE MIC TESTING PERFORMED ON SLUDGE EXTRACTED FROM THE PIPELINE INDICATES MICROBIOLOGICAL INFLUENCE CORROSION (MIC) MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.      LATERAL 60 WEST REMAINS SHUT-IN AND SCHEDULED FOR REPLACEMENT BOTH LATERAL 60 EAST AND WEST WILL BE ELIMINATED AND REPLACED WITH ONE LATERAL IN SUMMER 2016."

THE PIPELINE IDENTIFIED AS LINE D-533, IS A TRANSMISSION LINE, 3-IN IN DIAMETER LOCATED IN WOOD COUNTY, OHIO, NEAR THE VILLAGE OF RISING SUN.  AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, THE REPORTED RELEASE WAS FOUND TO BE FROM A DAMAGED 2-IN PIPELINE APPARENTLY BY A THIRD PARTY (LANDOWNER) WHILE FARMING HIS LAND. THIS DAMAGE TO LINE D-533 CAUSED THE LOSS OF 270 CUSTOMERS THAT ARE SERVICED BY THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY (LDC) DOWNSTREAM OF THE FAILURE POINT.  ALL EFFORTS WERE MADE BY COLUMBIA AND THE LDC PERSONNEL TO MAINTAIN MATERIAL FLOW TO THE LINE IN A SHORT TIMEFRAME.  AFTER PERFORMING THE NECESSARY ENGINEERING ASSESSMENT TO THE DAMAGED LINE, A PRE-TESTED PIPE WAS INSTALLED AND THE SERVICE TO LINE D-533 WAS RE-ESTABLISHED IN A SHORT TIMEFRAME.  EVEN THOUGH THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MATERIAL VENTED INTO ATMOSPHERE WAS LESS THAN 3,000 MCF (883.0 MCF) WITH THE TOTAL COST OF LABOR PLUS MATERIAL REACHING A TOTAL VALUE LESS THAN $50,000, COLUMBIA ELECTED TO REPORT THIS EVENT AS AN INCIDENT DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF LDC CUSTOMERS THAT LOST THEIR SERVICE FOR A BRIEF AMOUNT OF TIME.  THE LINE WAS REPAIRED AND SERVICE WAS RESUMED TO THE AFFECTED LDC CUSTOMERS.  COLUMBIA REACHED OUT TO THE FARMER (BEING PART OF THE PUBLIC AWARENESS PROGRAM) ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FARMING ON OR NEAR AN ACTIVE TRANSMISSION LINE AND TO EXERCISE CAUTION WHILE FARMING/HARVESTING CROP WITHIN THE RIGHT-OF-WAY IDENTIFYING THE INSTALLED LINE MARKERS. THIS STEP WILL HELP AVOID SIMILAR DAMAGE FROM RE-OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE TO THE SAME PIPELINE AND OTHER PIPELINES."

VINCENT COMPRESSOR STATION IN KITTSON COUNTY, MINNESOTA.  THE INCIDENT, WHICH RESULTED IN A SHUTDOWN OF THE PIPELINE VALVE SECTION BETWEEN THE COMPRESSOR STATION AND MLV 1-1-2, WAS THE RESULT OF A CONNECTION FAILURE OF A TWO-INCH DIAMETER PIG SIGNAL COMPONENT AT THE ABOVEMENTIONED LOCATION.  GAS WAS RELEASED AND SUBSEQUENTLY IGNITED.   FOLLOWING CONTROL OF THE RELEASE AND CONTROLLED BLOWDOWN OF THE PIPELINE SECTION, THE AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK CONFIRMED AS A FAILED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE BASE OF A PIG SIGNAL OFFTAKE TUBE AND A BOLTED MOUNTING PLATE ATTACHED TO THE GLGT 200 LINE.      THE DAMAGED PIG SIGNAL COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THE PIG SIGNAL OFFTAKE TUBE WITH ASSOCIATED BASE (WHICH WAS ALREADY DISCONNECTED FROM THE PIPELINE) AND THE  LOWER MOUNTING PLATE, WERE REMOVED FROM THE PIPELINE AND SENT TO A THIRD-PARTY LABORATORY FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS.

FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE REPAIR, THE PIPELINE WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE THE AFTERNOON OF SEPTEMBER 22, 2015.    FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE PIG SIGNAL COMPONENTS INDICATED THAT THREE (3) OF THE FOUR (4) FASTENERS, SOCKET HEAD CAP SCREWS (SHCS), OF THE BOLTED MOUNTING PLATE CONNECTION FAILED BY A TIME-DEPENDENT, STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC) MECHANISM. THE WEST SHCS FAILURE MAY HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY ADDITIONAL FACTORS DUE TO ITS VERY HIGH HARDNESS AND POSSIBLE UN-TEMPERED MARTENSITIC CONDITION. THE SOUTH SHCS FAILED LAST AND EXHIBITED WITH MIXED SCC AND DUCTILE RUPTURE MODES. ITS REMAINING LIGAMENT FAILED SUDDENLY WHEN ITS LOAD BEARING CAPACITY WAS EXCEEDED."

DURING THAT CALL THE PRODUCER MENTIONED THAT A RELIEF VALVE WAS RELIEVING.  THE PRODUCER DID NOT SAY THAT IT WAS EPNG'S RELIEF VALVE AND THE EPNG CONTROLLER BELIEVED THE REFERENCE WAS TO A PRODUCER RELIEF VALVE.  FURTHER, MAOP WAS NOT EXCEEDED AND THERE WERE NO ALARMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MONUMENT STATION SO THE GAS CONTROLLER DID NOT TAKE ANY ACTION RELATED TO THE RELIEF VALVE.  THE PRODUCER CALLED AGAIN AT 2:13AM MTN ON AUGUST 9, 2015 TO REPORT THAT THEY HEARD AN EPNG RELIEF VALVE RELIEVING IN THE MONUMENT STATION.  THE EPNG GAS CONTROLLER CALLED OUT THE LOCAL OPERATIONS SPECIALIST WHO ARRIVED AT THE STATION AT 2:40AM.  BY 3:00AM MTN THE UNIT SUCTION AND DISCHARGE HAD BEEN CLOSED AND THE VENTING HAD BEEN STOPPED.  THE GAS LOSS ORIGINALLY REPORTED TO THE NRC WAS REVISED TO 5521MCF BASED ON ENGINEERING CALCULATIONS (ORIGINALLY CALCULATED AS A 4"" ORIFICE BUT THE RELIEF VALVE IS A 1.28"" ORIFICE).   AN INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT DETERMINED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE ACTUATED AT A PRESSURE BELOW THE MAOP OF THE FACILITY AND VENTED GAS TO ATMOSPHERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS.  THE RELIEF VALVE WAS INSPECTED ON AUGUST 12, 2015 AND THE CAUSE OF THE EQUIPMENT FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.  THE RELIEF VALVE SEAT WAS LAPPED, THE SET POINT RESET AND TESTED, AND PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE.  CONTRIBUTING TO THE INCIDENT WERE THE CONTROLLERS ACTIONS.  IT WAS FOUND THAT THE CONTROLLER LACKED AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CONSTITUTES A POTENTIAL ABNORMAL OPERATION AND FAILED TO THOROUGHLY QUESTION WHICH RELIEF VALVE WAS VENTING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT THE DEVICE IN QUESTION WAS AN EPNG DEVICE.  THE CONTROLLER'S OQ WAS REVOKED AND THE CONTROLLER WAS GIVEN EXTENSIVE RE-TRAINING WITH A FOCUS ON THE IDENTIFICATION OF ABNORMAL OPERATIONS AND THE APPROPRIATE TIMELY RESPONSE REQUIRED."

THE PIPELINE, WHICH HAS AN MAOP OF 650 PSIG, IS 24-INCHES OD, X52 GRADE, WITH A NOMINAL WALL THICKNESS OF 0.250 INCHES. THE ELECTRONIC FLASH WELDED PIPE WAS MANUFACTURED BY AO SMITH AND INSTALLED IN 1950. FLOW IN THE PIPELINE IS SEASONALLY BI-DIRECTIONAL AND WAS STATIC AT A PRESSURE OF 634 PSI (58% SMYS BASED ON NOMINAL PROPERTIES) AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE. GAS RELEASED FROM THE FAILURE LOCATION DID NOT IGNITE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, FATALITIES OR DAMAGE TO SURROUNDING STRUCTURES OR THE ENVIRONMENT.    INVESTIGATIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE INCIDENT REVEALED THAT A FAILURE OF THE WAX-TYPE COATING APPLIED DURING ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION CONTRIBUTED TO THE EVENTUAL FORMATION OF TRANSGRANULAR STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC), ALSO KNOW AS NEAR NEUTRAL PH SCC, IN THE PIPE, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE PIPELINE FAILURE. THUS, THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS THE NEAR NEUTRAL PH SCC, AS DOCUMENTED BY A THIRD-PARTY METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. AND THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE SCC ON THE RUPTURED PIPE WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE COATING THAT FAILED TO PERFORM ITS INTENDED PURPOSE OF ELIMINATING THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMPONENT REQUIRED FOR TRANSGRANULAR SCC TO INITIATE AND PROPAGATE.    CONCURRENT TO THE ROOT CAUSE FAILURE INVESTIGATION, WHICH INCLUDED A REVIEW OF THE RESPONSE OF OPERATIONS AND GAS CONTROL PERSONNEL DURING THE EVENT, REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE 8250 LINE, INCLUDING SUBSEQUENT MULTIPLE PRESSURE TESTS TO ASSURE PIPELINE FACILITY INTEGRITY AND SAFETY."

AN AUDIBLE RELEASE OF GAS WAS DISCOVERED BY THE THIRD PARTY PRODUCER EMANATING FROM BENEATH A RISER CLAMP AND REPORTED TO TRANSCANADA/ANR PIPELINE COMPANY (ANR), OPERATOR FOR TCO.  THE LEAK WAS LOCATED ABOVE THE WATER LINE ON THE PIPELINE RISER NEAR MILEPOST 0 ON THE 757 12' TRANSMISSION LINE ON A PLATFORM OWNED BY ENERGY XXI (28.45374, -91.456405).      THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER ON 15 MAY 2015 AT 18:08 CDT (REPORT #116658).  FOLLOWING THE REPORT OF THE INCIDENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, ANR MAINTAINED CONTACT AND UPDATED U.S. COAST GUARD, BSEE, AND PHMSA.    FOLLOWING THE DISCOVERY LEAK, THE 10.83 MILE PIPELINE SECTION WAS ISOLATED AT 09:30 CDT ON 16 MAY 2015 FROM EI259 TO EUGENE ISLAND 231.  THE PIPELINE WAS ATTEMPTED TO BE BLOWN DOWN BEGINNING ON 16 MAY, WHEN PROCESS WATER WAS DISCOVERED IN THE PIPELINE.  DURING THE BLOW DOWN, THE WATER FROM THE PIPELINE WAS PROCESSED BY A VENT SCRUBBER AND STORED IN TANKS AT THE PLATFORM ON EI259.  ADDITIONALLY, A GAS BUSTER WAS USED TO FURTHER REDUCE THE PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE AND REMOVE PROCESS WATER.      ON 18 MAY 2015 AT 06:45, A PIPELINE TECHNICIAN OBSERVED THE PRESENCE OF SHEEN ON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER FROM LEAK LOCATION.   AN ADDITIONAL NRC REPORT WAS FILED ON 18 MAY 2015 AT (NRC REPORT #1116799).  LOCATION AND AREA OF THE SHEEN WAS MONITORED UNTIL THE LEAKING CEASED ON 21 MAY 2015.    ON 24 MAY 2015, VENTING WAS COMPLETED, THE LINE WAS PURGED WITH NITROGEN, AND PREPARATIONS WERE MADE TO REPAIR THE LINE.     FOLLOWING VENTING OF THE LINE, THE CLAMP ON THE PIPELINE RISER WAS REMOVED AND NON-DESTRUCTIVE EXAMINATION (MAG PARTICLE) WAS PERFORMED ON THE LEAK AREA.

LATERAL 60 WEST IS A 6"" PIPELINE (APPROXIMATELY 1 1/2 MILES LONG) LOCATED IN CONSUMERS ENERGY'S CRANBERRY STORAGE FIELD, MARION, MICHIGAN (MISSAUKEE COUNTY).    ADDITIONAL CE EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ON-SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 14:00 ON MAY 15, 2015 TO BEGIN IMPLEMENTING THE STANDARD PRECAUTIONARY LOCK OUT TAG OUT PROCESS, ISOLATING AND SHUTTING DOWN LATERAL 60 WEST AND BARRICADING THE LOCATION UNTIL FURTHER INVESTIGATION COULD BE PERFORMED. THE BLOW-DOWN PROCESS WAS COMPLETE AND THE LINE SHUT-DOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 14:30.      ON MONDAY, MAY 18, 2015 A 11/2 FOOT SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS CUT OUT AND A PINHOLE LEAK DISCOVERED.  THE LEAK WAS VISUALLY EXAMINED AND PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED CORROSION AS A POSSIBLE LEAK SOURCE.      THE APPROXIMATE GAS LOSS OF 3.6 MMCF WAS ESTIMATED BASED ON INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM THE LEAK PATROL CONDUCTED ON MARCH 18, 2015.  THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF ABNORMAL CONDITIONS AT THIS LOCATION AT THAT TIME.     THE DAMAGED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE CONSUMERS ENERGY TRAIL STREET LABORATORY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. THE LABORATORY ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE LEAK WAS A RESULT OF A LOCALIZED CORROSION PIT ON THE PIPE ID WHICH DEVELOPED AN OVAL THROUGH WALL HOLE AT THE OD MEASURING APPROXIMATELY .375""X 0.25"".       THE PRESENCE OF SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF SULFUR WITHIN THE PIT INDICATES MICROBIOLOGICAL INFLUENCE CORROSION (MIC) CAUSED BY SULFATE-REDUCING BACTERIA (SRB) MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.  HOWEVER, IT COULD NOT BE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE DAMAGE MEETS THE THREE CRITERIA REQUIRED TO VALIDATE MIC.    IN ADDITION TO COMPREHENSIVE METALLURGICAL TESTING, CONSUMERS ENERGY CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF THE 2005 TOOL DATA AND IDENTIFIED TWO DIG LOCATIONS AS VERIFICATION. THE LOCATIONS, DIG #1 JT 60 AND DIG #2 JT 117,  WERE EXPOSED, EXAMINED AND ONE SECTION (DIG #2 JT 117) WAS REPLACED DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF MINOR CORROSION.  ULTRASONIC THICKNESS (UT) SENSORS WERE ALSO INSTALLED AT THESE TWO LOCATION TO MONITOR INTERNAL CORROSION.  REMEDIATION WORK WAS COMPLETED AND LATERAL 60 WEST WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON OCTOBER 7, 2016.    ON OCTOBER 24, 2015 AN ADDITIONAL LEAK WAS DISCOVERED ON LATERAL 60 WEST APPROXIMATELY 677 FEET NORTH OF THE LEAK IDENTIFIED IN MAY.  AN INCIDENT REPORT-GAS TRANSMISSION AND GATHERING PIPELINE SYSTEMS (2015140-16931) WAS SUBMITTED TO PHMSA ON NOVEMBER 24, 2015.    LABORATORY ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE LEAK DISCOVERED IN OCTOBER WAS A RESULT OF A LOCALIZED CORROSION PIT ON THE PIPE ID.  THE MIC TESTING PERFORMED ON SLUDGE EXTRACTED FROM THE PIPE INDICATES MICROBIOLOGICAL INFLUENCE CORROSION (MIC) MAY HAVE CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE."

LINE 100A IS A 20"" INTRASTATE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE STRETCHING APPROXIMATELY 60 MILES FROM FREEDOM COMPRESSOR STATION IN MANCHESTER, MICHIGAN (WASHTENAW COUNTY) TO OVID SUBSTATION IN OVID, MICHIGAN (CLINTON COUNTY).      CONSUMERS ENERGY EMPLOYEES ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 00:26 HOURS ON MAY 5, 2015 AND ISOLATED A 12 MILE SEGMENT OF LINE 100A UTILIZING EMERGENCY VALVES LOCATED AT THE CHELSEA INTERCHANGE NEAR CHELSEA, MICHIGAN (WASHTENAW COUNTY) AS WELL AS STOCKBRIDGE CITY GATE IN STOCKBRIDGE, MICHIGAN (INGHAM COUNTY).  GAS WAS SHUT OFF TO THE RUPTURED SEGMENT OF PIPELINE AT APPROXIMATELY 00:33.    EMPLOYEES ARRIVING ON SITE TO ISOLATE THE AFFECTED SEGMENT CONFIRMED THE LOCATION OF THE PIPELINE RUPTURE NEAR SOUTH LAKE DRIVE AND ROEPKE ROAD IN CHELSEA AT APPROXIMATELY 01:09.  LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL WERE ALSO ON SITE RESPONDING.  NO INJURIES, FATALITIES, OR IGNITION OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE RELEASE.     THE DAMAGED PIPELINE AND ASSOCIATED FRAGMENTS WERE SECURED AND TRANSPORTED TO CONSUMERS ENERGY'S TRAIL STREET LABORATORY FOR METALLURGICAL TESTING AND DETERMINATION OF A FAILURE MODE.  PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC).  THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL SCC CONDITIONS ON LINE 100A HAS RESULTED IN CONSUMERS ENERGY TAKING A REDUCTION IN PRESSURE FOR LINE 100A OF MORE THAN 20% OF THE OPERATING PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF CONDITION DETERMINATION.  THIS REDUCTION WAS MADE FOR THE ENTIRETY OF LINE 100A BETWEEN FREEDOM AND OVID, AND WAS COMPLETED ON JUNE 2, 2015 PENDING ADDITIONAL INTEGRITY MANAGEMENT TESTING AND REMEDIATION.    REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AND HYDROSTATIC TESTING WERE PERFORMED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATIONS AND LIVE GAS WAS RETURNED TO THE RELEVANT PORTIONS OF LINE 100A, FREEDOM COMPRESSOR STATION TO OVID VALVE SITE ON JANUARY 16, 2016."

THE NEW ASSEMBLY WAS TESTED AND VERIFIED AT THE SET POINT OF 450 PSIG.    DISASSEMBLY OF THE FISHER 6358EBH PILOT DISCOVERED A FAILED O-RING UNDER THE DIAPHRAGM. THE FAILED O-RING IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE PREMATURE OPERATION OF THE RELIEF VALVE.    A TREND OF THE FUEL RUN PRESSURE WAS REVIEWED AND A PRESSURE DROP WAS OBSERVED AT 15:52 HOURS ON 4/4/15.

THE SECTION OF PIPE THAT LEAKED WAS SENT TO A 3RD PARTY LABORATORY FOR FAILURE ANALYSIS.  THE RESULT OF THE 3RD PARTY ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD OF THE PIPE WALL AT THE WELD TOE.  THE PRIMARY FACTOR TO THE FAILURE WAS SETTLEMENT OF THE BRANCH CONNECTION DUE TO IMPROPER SUPPORT.  THE SETTLEMENT CAUSED BENDING STRESSES IN THE CARRIER PIPE AT THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT FILLET WELD WHICH RESULTED IN THE FORMATION OF A CRACK.  THE GEOMETRY OF THE FILLET WELD THAT ATTACHED THE SADDLE REINFORCEMENT PAD TO THE CARRIER PIPE WAS ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE.  THE SADDLE THICKNESS WAS 2.5 TIMES THE THICKNESS OF THE CARRIER PIPE WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A STRESS CONCENTRATION IN THE THINNER PIPE AT THE FILLET WELD TOE.  UNDERCUT AT THE TOE OF THE FILLET WELD FURTHER CONCENTRATED THE STRESS AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FORMATION OF A CRACK."

THE COMPRESSOR STATION HEADER WAS ISOLATED AND THE SECTION WAS BLOWN DOWN TO STOP THE UNINTENDED RELEASE.    PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATIONS INDICATED THAT THE SUPPLY TUBING HAD A LOW POINT THAT ALLOWED FOR THE COLLECTION OF MOISTURE WHICH, APPARENTLY, FROZE AND ISOLATED THE ACTUATOR FROM THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) TRIGGER AIR SUPPLY.  THEN, A NUISANCE LEAK WAS FOUND IN THE LAST TUBING CONNECTION TO THE ACTUATOR.  THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO FINDINGS, ALLOWED THE ESD TRIGGER PRESSURE ON THIS VALVE ACTUATOR TO LEAK DOWN TO THE POINT THE VALVE ACTUATED INADVERTENTLY, RELEASING MATERIAL INTO ATMOSPHERE.

THE SOUTH MAIN LINE LOOP WAS DEPRESSURIZED AND REMOVED FROM SERVICE AND REPAIRS WERE INITIATED.  A CRACKED WELD WAS DISCOVERED ON THE HOT TAP FITTING.  THE SECTION OF PIPE CONTAINING THE HOT TAP ASSEMBLY WAS REPLACED WITH NEW PRETESTED SEGMENT OF PIPE.  SNG WILL COMPLETE INSTALLATION OF A NEW HOT TAP ASSEMBLY.  NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS IMPACTED BY THE INCIDENT.  AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.      THE METALLURGICAL REPORT REGARDING THE NPS 16 X NPS 6 HOT TAP FITTING AT THE DSM CHEMICAL METER STATION AT MP 491.127 IN RICHMOND COUNTY, GA ON THE SOUTHERN NATURAL GAS (SNG) SOUTH MAIN LOOP LINE WAS COMPLETED JUNE 2015.   THE SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS PRESENTED IN THE REPORT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:    - THE HOT TAP FITTING LEAKED AT THE TOE OF THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL FILLET WELD JOINING THE FITTING TO THE IN-SERVICE PIPE.    - THE LEAK WAS DUE TO A HYDROGEN CRACK AT THE TOE OF THE WELD.    - THE UNUSUALLY HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE IN-SERVICE PIPE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRACKING.    THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THE UNUSUALLY HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE IN-SERVICE PIPE AS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THE CRACKING.  A REVIEW OF AVAILABLE RECORDS WAS COMPLETED FOLLOWING THE ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER SEGMENTS ON THE SOUTH MAIN LOOP LINE, WITH SAME VINTAGE OF PIPE AND TAPS, THAT MAY EXIST AND REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OR MONITORING.  FROM A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE RECORDS, NO OTHER HOT-TAPS ON PIPE CONTAINING A HIGH CARBON EQUIVALENT WERE IDENTIFIED.  FROM THIS REVIEW, SNG DETERMINED THAT OTHER TAPS OR CONNECTIONS WERE EITHER WELD-IN FITTINGS, WHICH ARE NOT AS PRONE TO HYDROGEN CRACKING, OR WERE INSTALLED ON A DIFFERENT VINTAGE OF PIPE."

TRANSCANADA EMPLOYEES FROM THE GLGT ST. VINCENT COMPRESSOR STATION NEAR ST. VINCENT, MINNESOTA, RESPONDED TO THE REPORT AND ARRIVED AT THE MLV SITE AT 1:20 PM CDT.  WHEN EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE MLV SITE, THEY OBSERVED THE VALVE SITE TO BE PARTIALLY FLOODED AND GAS BUBBLES TO BE EMANATING FROM NEAR THE BASE OF THE UPSTREAM 20-INCH BLOWDOWN VALVE (1-2-2Y) ON THE 200 LINE PIPELINE.  USE OF A GAS DETECTOR REVEALED LOW LEVELS (APPROXIMATELY 10% LEL) OF GAS NEAR THE LEAK SITE.  THE UPSTREAM  PIPELINE SECTION BETWEEN MLV 1-1-2  TO MLV 1-2-2 WAS THEN SHUT IN AND ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM.  AFTER PUMPING THE FLOODWATER FROM THE VALVE SITE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS ORIGINATING FROM A FILLET WELD ON A 2-INCH WELD-O-LET THAT CONNECTED A 2-INCH POWER GAS LINE TO THE 20-INCH BLOWDOWN RISER.  THE UPSTREAM PIPELINE SECTION WAS THEN BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.      THIS POWER GAS LINE WAS CONNECTED TO THE RISER AT GROUND LEVEL.  BECAUSE THIS CONNECTION WAS SITUATED AT GROUND LEVEL, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT OVER TIME FROST HEAVE PLACED STRESSES ON THE POWER GAS LINE, EVENTUALLY RESULTING IN THE FORMATION OF A CRACK ON THE LOWER SIDE OF THE SUBJECT  FILLET WELD AND THE EVENTUAL  LEAK.  BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, THE POWER GAS CONNECTION TO THE DOWNSTREAM BLOWDOWN RISER WAS ALSO INSPECTED, WHICH REVEALED THE COATING TO BE CRACKED ON THE SIMILAR FILLET WELD AS THE UPSTREAM LOCATION.  NONDESTRUCTIVE TESTING OF THIS WELD REVEALED THAT THE WELD WAS NOT CRACKED.  NONE-THE-LESS, BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM POWER GAS CONNECTIONS WOULD BE REPLACED.  AT THIS POINT, THE DOWNSTREAM PIPELINE SECTION BETWEEN MLV 1-2-2 AND MLV 1-3-2 WAS SHUT IN, ISOLATED FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM, AND BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE.     IN ADDITION TO THE REPLACEMENT OF THE POWER GAS PIPING, SECTIONS OF BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM 20-INCH RISERS WERE REPLACED BECAUSE  THE POWER GAS CONNECTIONS WERE RELOCATED TO MORE SUITABLE LOCATIONS ON THE FACILITY PIPING, MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF ANY FUTURE FROST HEAVE ACTIVITY.

WHILE PREPARING TO DISPATCH AN INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR VESSEL TO THE SITE, A PIPELINE SEGMENT OF 18.4 MILES WAS ISOLATED AND BLOWN DOWN FROM 830 PSIG TO 200 PSIG FROM THE VALVES AT SOUTH MARSH ISLAND 76 TO EUGENE ISLAND 199.  ADDITIONALLY, ANR SCHEDULED AERIAL PATROLS TO MONITOR THE LEAK.  NO SHEEN OR PRODUCT WAS DOCUMENTED AT THE SITE FOR THE DURATION OF THE LEAK AND REPAIR.    THE REPAIR VESSEL AND CONTRACT EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE INCIDENT LOCATION ON 15 MARCH AT 13:27 CDT AND BEGIN EXPOSING THE PIPE FOR THE LEAK INVESTIGATION.    FOLLOWING THE REMOVAL OF THE COVER MATERIAL, THE INVESTIGATION BY THE DIVERS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY A DEFECT IN A BODY BLEED THREADED PLUG VALVE ON A 12-INCH SIDE VALVE.  THE THREADED PLUG VALVE ON THE BODY BLEED WAS REPLACED ON 16 MARCH AT 17:59 CDT.     FOLLOWING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE THREADED PLUG VALVE, THE LINE WAS INSPECTED TO CONFIRM THE REPAIR AND THE LINE AND VALVE WERE RE-COVERED.

THE SEGMENT FROM VALVE SECTION 66-1 TO 67-1 WAS SECURED AND PROMPTLY BLOWN DOWN TO ISOLATE THE LEAK AND INITIATE REPAIRS.   THE IMPACTED SEGMENT OF PIPE WAS SENT OFF FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS ON MARCH 6, 2015 AND THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE FRACTURE INITIATED FROM MULTIPLE ORIGINS ON THE INSIDE SURFACE OF THE PIPE AT THE PEAK OF THE WRINKLE. THE FRACTURE MODE WAS BRITTLE (QUASI-CLEAVAGE). THE FRACTURE SHOWED NO EVIDENCE OF FATIGUE AND THE FRACTURE LOCATION WAS ON THE TOP OF A RIDGE CONTAINING TWO 1 SAG WRINKLE BENDS.  CONSTRUCTION RECORDS INDICATE THE WRINKLE BENDS WERE COLD-FORMED AND COLD WORK COULD REDUCE DUCTILITY. THE COLD-FORMED REGION IS ALSO POTENTIALLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO STRAIN-AGING, WHICH COULD ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO LOWER DUCTILITY. THESE FACTORS COULD INCREASE THE DUCTILE TO BRITTLE TRANSITION TEMPERATURE OF THE WRINKLE BEND COMPARED TO THE PIPE BODY.    RESULTS OF THE ROOT-CAUSE ANALYSIS SHOW THAT THE PRIMARY METALLURGICAL FAILURE MECHANISM WAS BRITTLE FRACTURE AND THAT THE CRACK APPEARS TO HAVE FAILED BY TENSILE OVERLOAD. TGP WAS UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF EACH OF THE TENSILE FORCES, BUT THE TENSILE OVERLOAD DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A RESULT OF THIRD&#8208;PARTY DAMAGE OR OBSERVABLE LAND MOVEMENT.

WHILE LOCAL FIELD PERSONNEL WAS EN ROUTE, AT 1145 HOURS, PG&E DISPATCH RECEIVED A REPORT OF THIRD PARTY DAMAGE TO PG&E'S PIPELINE NEAR 610 VIEJO RD IN CARMEL THAT RESULTED IN AN UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF GAS. A HOMEOWNER HIRED A DAY LABORER TO GRADE HIS PROPERTY FOR A NEW ROADWAY, AND THE DAY LABORER STRUCK THE 10-INCH STEEL TRANSMISSION LINE WITH A RIPPER TOOTH PULLED BY A BULLDOZER. THE HOMEOWNER AND THE LABORER DID NOT CALL USA. PG&E'S GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE WAS ON SITE AT 1201 HOURS. CREWS WERE ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1215 HOURS. FIRE DEPARTMENT, POLICE, AND LOCAL MEDIA WERE OBSERVED ON SCENE. HIGHWAY 1 WAS TEMPORARILY CLOSED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED 6 HOMES OUT OF PRECAUTION.  PG&E STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS AT 1510 HOURS BY CLOSING FOUR MAINLINE VALVES TO ISOLATE THE IMPACTED PIPELINE SECTION.  A DISTRIBUTION BACK-TIE AROUND THE DAMAGED DFM SECTION WAS ABLE TO SUPPLY GAS TO THE AFFECTED AREA. COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS WAS USED TO SUPPLEMENT GAS SUPPLY; HOWEVER PG&E HAD TO CURTAIL FOUR NON-CORE CUSTOMERS..  THE FOUR IMPACTED CUSTOMERS WERE ABLE TO HAVE GAS SERVICE RESTORED BY 1000 HOURS ON MARCH 1, 2015.  ON MARCH 5, 2015, A VISUAL INTEGRITY ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED ON DFM 1815-15 AND NO ADDITIONAL DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED ON THE PIPE, SO DFM 1815-15 WAS RESTORED TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE.

THE 42"" PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT 1296 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, WITH AN ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE (MAOP) OF 1480 PSIG.  THERE WAS NO FIRE, EXPLOSION, INJURY/DEATH, OR MAJOR PRIVATE PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUPTURE.  FIFTY FAMILIES WERE EVACUATED BY LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.    THE FIRST SCADA SAFETY RELATED LINE BREAK ALARM FOR THE MEXICO COMPRESSOR STATION WAS RECEIVED IN THE OPERATIONAL CONTROL CENTER (OCC) AT 17:56 CST.  THE CONTROLLER IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE ON-CALL STATION OPERATOR AT MEXICO COMPRESSOR STATION TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS AN ISSUE AT THE STATION.  THE VALVE DOWNSTREAM OF THE RUPTURE SITE (MLV 65) CLOSED IMMEDIATELY UPON SENSING THE PRESSURE DROP.  A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BOWLING GREEN FIRE DEPARTMENT CONTACTED OCC AT 18:15 CST, WHICH WAS FOLLOWED BY A CALL FROM THE PIKE COUNTY SHERIFF AT 18:20 CST TO COMMUNICATE THEIR ARRIVAL ON SITE.  AT 18:30 CST THE CONTROLLER SPOKE WITH LOCAL FIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WHO WERE IN ROUTE TO THE SITE.  TALLGRASS FIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AT 19:40 CST, MET WITH THE LOCAL INCIDENT COMMANDER, AND AT THAT TIME CONFIRMED THE RUPTURE.  FIELD OPERATIONS SUPERVISED THE BLOWDOWN OF GAS UNTIL IT WAS SAFE TO APPROACH THE RUPTURE SITE IN PREPARATION FOR THE INCIDENT INVESTIGATION.  AT 0:52 CST EMERGENCY RESPONSE ACTIVITIES CONCLUDED AND THE SITE WAS DEEMED SECURE.  INCIDENT INVESTIGATION AND CLEAN-UP BEGAN THE MORNING OF JANUARY 30, 2015.      THE FIELD INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT A WELD.  INCLUDED ARE BOTH THE UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM PIPE CHARACTERISTICS:  - UPSTREAM: X70, WT. 0.74, ARO   - DOWNSTREAM: X80, WT. 0.486, FBE   - 0.740"" BEVEL WAS PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASME B31.8 ANNEX I AND SHOWED EVIDENCE OF GOOD WORKMANSHIP    SUBSEQUENT TO THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DISCUSSION, AND WITH AGREEMENT FROM ALL PARTIES INVOLVED, IT WAS DEEMED THAT THE GIRTH WELD RUPTURE WAS AN OVERLOAD FAILURE CAUSED BY AXIAL STRESS THAT EXCEEDED THE CROSS SECTION TENSILE STRENGTH OF THE CRACK INITIATION LOCATION.  THIS DETERMINATION IS SUPPORTED BY CRACK CHARACTERISTICS, METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, POTENTIAL FAILURE MODES AND OBSERVATION OF THE PIPE GEOMETRY RESULTING FROM THE RUPTURE.  THE RCA IDENTIFIED FIVE AXIAL LOAD INDUCING VARIABLES THAT LIKELY LEAD TO THE EXCEEDANCE OF THE CROSS SECTION TENSILE STRENGTH, HOWEVER, NO SINGLE VARIABLE CAN BE BLAMED FOR THE OVERALL CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE. THE FIVE PREDOMINATE AXIAL LOAD INDUCING VARIABLES ARE AS FOLLOWS: PIPELINE SETTLEMENT, PIPELINE MISALIGNMENT, TEMPERATURE STRESSES, INTERNAL PRESSURE, AND CONSTRUCTION FORCES."

GAS WAS OBSERVED BUBBLING UP AROUND THE NECK OF THE BELOW GRADE 30-INCH BLOCK VALVE AND CONDENSATE WAS OBSERVED AT THE GROUND SURFACE OF THE VALVE WITHIN THE VALVE YARD.  INITIAL CLEANUP ACTIONS TO CONTAIN CONDENSATE INCLUDED DISPATCHING A VACUUM TRUCK AND THE DEPLOYMENT ABSORBENT PADS AND BOOM.  THE SITE WAS MONITORED DAILY WITH ADDITIONAL ABSORBENT MATERIALS DEPLOYED AS NECESSARY.    ON 12 JANUARY, A FIELD TECHNICIAN REPORTED THAT SHEEN HAD MIGRATED FROM THE VALVE YARD TO ADJACENT  PROPERTY OUTSIDE OF THE YARD VALVE FENCING CREATING SHEEN ON THE GROUND AND IN STANDING WATER.  A TRANSCANADA ENVIRONMENTAL SPECIALIST REPORTED THE RELEASE TO LOUISIANA STATE POLICE (LSP), INCIDENT #15-00155, AS A RELEASE OF CONDENSATE FROM THE VALVE SITE.      AFTER INVESTIGATING AND EVALUATING OPTIONS TO REPAIR THE VALVE, IT WAS DECIDED TO ISOLATE THE 767 LATERAL FROM WEST CAMERON 171 TO THE GRAND CHENIER LIQUID HANDLING FACILITY AND REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO ALLOW FURTHER INVESTIGATION.  ON 13 JANUARY, THE PIPELINE SECTION WAS ISOLATED AND THE LINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED BY FLARED BLOW DOWN AT GRAND CHENIER LIQUID HANDLING FACILITY.    PRESSURE REDUCTION AND FLARING CONTINUED UNTIL 19 JANUARY WHEN LINE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED TO ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION OF THE LEAK.  TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE VALVE AND FURTHER INVESTIGATE, SOIL WAS EXCAVATED AND CONTAINERIZED ONSITE AND APPROVAL IS PENDING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL.  ADDITIONALLY, IMPACTED WATER RECOVERED FROM THE EXCAVATION HAS BEEN CONTAINERIZED FOR DISPOSAL.    FOLLOWING THE EXCAVATION AND INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS THE RESULT OF A PRIMARY STEM SEAL FAILURE.  THE PRIMARY STEM SEAL WAS REPLACED ON VALVE 767-3-10 WITH THE REPAIRS COMPLETED ON 28 JANUARY.  FOLLOWING THE REPAIR, A PURGE AND LOAD PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED AND THE 767 LATERAL WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 2 FEBRUARY 2015.  IMPACTED SOIL AND WATER WILL REMAIN CONTAINERIZED AT THE SITE UNTIL APPROVED FOR TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL.    A DETERMINATION ON WHY THE STEM SEAL FAILED IS MOST LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO A MISALIGNMENT OR MANUFACTURER DEFECT.  THE FAILED O-RING SEAL WAS REMOVED FROM THE VALVE AND REPLACED WITH A NEW O-RING SEAL, WHICH REPAIRED THE LEAK AND ALLOWED THE LINE TO BE PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE.    INITIAL ESTIMATES FOR THE REPAIR AND REMEDIATION OF THE VALVE AND VALVE SITE DID NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO REPORT THE INCIDENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC).  FOLLOWING THE INITIAL INVESTIGATION AND DETERMINING ESTIMATES FOR THE VALVE REPAIR, THE TRANSPORTATION AND DISPOSAL OF IMPACTED SOIL AND WATER, AND REMEDIATION OF THE SITE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ESTIMATED REPAIR AND REMEDIATION FOR THE VALVE AND VALVE SITE BEGAN TO APPROACH AND COULD EXCEED $50,000 IN TOTAL COSTS.  UPON MAKING THIS DETERMINATION ON 27 JANUARY, TRANSCANADA REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE NRC (REPORT # 1106719) AND CONTACTED PHMSA SOUTHWEST REGIONAL.     FOLLOWING THE REPLACEMENT OF THE O-RING AND REPAIR OF THE VALVE, THE SITE WAS RESTORED AND REMEDIATED IN ACCORDANCE REGULATIONS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF LOUISIANA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY (LDEQ) AND THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (USEPA).  LIQUID PRODUCT ALONG WITH IMPACTED WATER AND SOIL WAS RECOVERED AND TRANSPORTED FOR PROPER DISPOSAL AND THE SITE HAS BEEN RESTORED."

ON JANUARY 16, 2015, A LOCAL RESIDENT REPORTED THE SOUND OF GAS AT THE STATION TO SOUTHERN NATURAL GAS PIPELINE COMPANY, LLC (SNG).   SNG GAS CONTROL RESPONDED BY DISPATCHING A LOCAL SNG FIELD TECHNICIAN AND HE IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE FUEL GAS METER RUN TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS SINCE HE OBSERVED THE RELIEF VALVE ON THE FIRST CUT OF THE MASTER FUEL RUN REPEATEDLY ACTIVATING AND RESETTING AT THE DESIGNATED SET-POINTS.   IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE STATION COMPRESSION WAS OFF-LINE DURING THE EVENT.   THE RESPONDING FIELD TECHNICIAN OBSERVED ICE BUILD-UP ON THE FIRST-CUT, REGULATOR SENSING LINE WHICH CAUSED THE REGULATOR TO MALFUNCTION AND THE RELIEF VALVE TO ACTUATE.        THE ESTIMATED GAS VOLUME RELEASED, USING METER STATION FLOW DATA, WAS 8,151 MSCF OVER A 23 HOUR PERIOD FROM 20:15 HOURS LOCAL TIME ON JANUARY 15, 2015 TO 19:05 HOURS LOCAL TIME ON JANUARY 16, 2015 WHEN SNG PERSONNEL ISOLATED THE FUEL METER STATION.    THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION BY SNG, COMPLETED ON JANUARY 30, 2015, SHOWED THAT ALTHOUGH A FUEL GAS HEATER WAS INSTALLED TO HEAT FUEL GAS FOR THE COMPRESSOR STATION, WHEN THE STATION TURBINES ARE OFFLINE, THE RESULTING LOW FUEL GAS FLOW (FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES ONLY) CAN ENABLE THE FUEL TEMPERATURE TO DROP, ESPECIALLY ON COLD DAYS, BEFORE THE GAS REACHES THE MASTER FUEL METER.  SNG CONCLUDED THAT DURING EXTENDED PERIODS OF BELOW-FREEZING TEMPERATURES, WITH LOW FLOW, THE FUEL TEMPERATURE CAN DROP AND CAUSES ICE BUILD-UP ON THE REGULATOR PILOT SENSING LINE.    SNG WILL COMPLETE THE FOLLOWING CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TO MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS OF FREEZING ON THE REGULATOR SENSING LINES AND INCREASE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF GAS RELEASE FROM OPP ON THE FUEL GAS SYSTEM:   1) INSTALLATION OF CATALYTIC HEATERS ON PILOT REGULATOR SENSING LINES TO PREVENT ICE BUILD-UP DURING CONDITIONS OF LOW GAS FLOW AND LOW AMBIENT TEMPERATURES.    2) INSTALLATION OF ADDITIONAL PRESSURE TRANSMITTER TO DETECT FLOW THROUGH THE MASTER FUEL METER RELIEVE VALVE AND GENERATE A SYSTEM ALARM WHEN THE PRESSURE APPROACHES THE RELIEF VALVE SET POINT.  THIS WILL PROMPT A CALL-OUT TO STATION PERSONNEL."

STANTON CS IS A TRANSMISSION FACILITY THAT IS OWNED, OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY COLUMBIA GULF TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA).  THE FACILITY IS LOCATED IN THE TOWN OF STANTON IN POWELL COUNTY, KENTUCKY.     THE STATION OPERATOR IDENTIFIED THE RV TO BE ON LINE 100 DISCHARGE PIPE.  AFTER 25 MINUTES, THE OPERATOR WAS ABLE TO MANUALLY SECURE THE RV AND NO MATERIAL WAS NOTED TO BE VENTING INTO ATMOSPHERE THEREAFTER.  INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT WAS INITIATED THE FOLLOWING DAY WHERE IT INVOLVED A TEAM FROM COLUMBIA COMPRESSOR ENGINEERING SUPPORT AND COMPRESSOR OPERATIONS PERSONNEL.  A CONTACT WITH THE RV ENGINEERING TECHNICAL SUPPORT WAS ESTABLISHED TO DETERMINE IF ANY HELP MAY BE PROVIDED TO DETERMINE THE PROBABLE CAUSE THAT LED TO THE INADVERTENT ACTIVATION OF THIS RV.  THE RV ENGINEERING TECHNICAL SUPPORT INDICATED THAT BASED ON THE PROVIDED INFORMATION WHERE THE RV ACTIVATED BEFORE ACHIEVING THE SET POINT VALUE, IT WAS NOTED THAT IT MAY BE DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF FROST IN THE BODY OF THE RV THAT MAY HAVE INITIATED THIS UNINTENDED RELEASE.  FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS ARE STILL ONGOING INTO THIS INCIDENT.  THE FACILITY WAS RETURNED BACK TO SERVICE AFTER THE RV WAS BENCH TESTED AND EVALUATED WHERE ALL PERFORMED CHECKS DID NOT INDICATE OF ANY MALFUNCTIONS.  HENCE, THE RV WAS RETURNED BACK INTO SERVICE.    THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA) REPORT FOR THIS INCIDENT IDENTIFIED THAT COLLECTED MOISTURE HAD SEEPED THROUGH A FAILED O-RING IN THE RV PISTON CAVITY.  DUE TO THE REDUCED TEMPERATURE THAT WAS WIDESPREAD THROUGHOUT THE REGION (18 DEGREES F), THE COLLECTED MOISTURE FROZE, THENCE, FORCING THE RV TO UNSEAT AND RELEASING UNINTENTIONALLY MATERIAL INTO ATMOSPHERE.  FOLLOW-UP ACTION ITEMS TO THE RCA REPORT WERE TO ENSURE THAT THE DRILLED VENT PASSAGE FOR THE SPRING CHAMBER OF THE RELIEF CONTROL CARTRIDGE SHOULD BE SEALED USING A SMALL AMOUNT OF GREASE SO THAT MOISTURE WILL NOT COLLECT IN THE CAVITY. VINTAGE RV ON THE DISCHARGE LINE OF CENTRIFUGAL COMPRESSORS WITH OBSOLETE SPARE PARTS, WILL BE REPLACED AND/OR PHASED-OUT FROM THE PIPELINE SYSTEM SUBJECT TO OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS.

THE PRESSURE IN L-300B AT THE TIME THE RELIEF VALVE OPERATED WAS 720 PSIG. THE INCIDENT WAS IDENTIFIED ON PG&E'S SCADA SYSTEM. IN RESPONSE, PG&E GAS CONTROL REMOTELY LOWERED THE PRESSURE IN L-300B BY LOWERING THE SETPOINT OF THE UPSTREAM REGULATOR TO 675 PSIG, WHICH ALLOWED THE PRESSURE RELIEF VALVE TO CLOSE AT 1710 HOURS.  PG&E PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 1745 HOURS AND THE VALVE'S SET POINT OF 749 PSIG WAS TESTED AND VERIFIED.  PG&E CONTRACTED A THIRD PARTY ENGINEERING FIRM TO PERFORM A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE STATION. PG&E IMPLEMENTED SEVERAL MODIFICATIONS AND IS CURRENTLY IN THE DESIGN PHASE TO REBUILD PLS-4.

APPARENTLY, NBPL EXPERIENCED SOME REGULATOR ISSUES THAT CAUSED FLOWS TO INCREASE AND THE PRESSURE TO EXCEED THE 830 PSIG SET POINT. NORTHERN BELIEVES NBPL EXPERIENCED TWO REGULATOR FAILURES AS THE RELIEF HAS SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO PROTECT THE 800 PSIG MAOP IN A SINGLE REGULATOR FAILURE MODE; THE PRESSURE IN THE 800 PSIG MAOP MNB91501 LINE REACHED 894 PSIG FOR A BRIEF PERIOD EXCEEDING THE MAOP PLUS ALLOWABLE BUILDUP BY 14 PSIG. CALCULATIONS INDICATE IT WOULD TAKE TWO REGULATORS TO FAIL TO REACH THIS PRESSURE WITH THE RELIEF WIDE OPEN.   MOREOVER, THE PIPELINE PRODUCES A HOOP STRESS OF 39% SMYS AT ITS 800 MAOP. THE HOOP STRESS WAS CALCULATED AS 42% AT THE OVERPRESSURE CONDITION, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE ALLOWABLE STRESS FOR PIPE IN THIS LOCATION. THIS EVENT RESULTED IN A REPORTABLE INCIDENT BECAUSE 13.9 MMCF OF NATURAL GAS WAS LOST.   ACCORDING TO 191.23(B)(2), A SRC SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED SINCE THE EVENT RESULTS IN AN INCIDENT BEFORE THE DEADLINE FOR FILING A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT.  NORTHERN BORDER PIPELINE CURRENTLY IS OPERATING ITS REGULATORS AT A REDUCED PRESSURE AND VOLUME UNTIL THE PROBABLE CAUSE CAN BE DETERMINED.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE WAS A FAILURE OF CONTROL VALVES OWNED AND OPERATED BY NOTHERN BORDER PIPELINE COMPANY (NBPL). IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTABLISH THE EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS DUE TO THE LACK OF VALVE POSITION FEEDBACK ON NBPL'S SYSTEM, AND SINCE NO DETERMINATION HAS BEEN MADE WHY THEIR PNEUMATIC BACK-UP CONTROLLERS DID NOT OVERRIDE THEIR DIGITAL CONTROL LOOP TO TAKE OVER CONTROL OF THE PRESSURE. IT IS CLEAR, HOWEVER, THAT NBPL FAILED TO CONTROL PRESSURE TO THE POINT WHERE PRESSURE INCREASED TO CAUSE NORTHERN'S RELIEF VALVE TO VENT. NBPL DID INDICATE BOTH OF THEIR CONTROL VALVES WERE AT 96% OPEN."

CALLS REPORTING SMOKE AND FIRE WERE EXPLAINED TO BE ONLY LOUD NOISE, DUST AND DEBRIS FROM THE PSV LINE.    A PLANT INVESTIGATION PROCESS WAS INITIATED AND COMPLETED.  THE ORIGINAL CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A FAULT IN THE PLC.  UPON INVESTIGATING WHY THE FLARE/VENT LINE HAD NOT RELEASED, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE VENT BLOCK VALVE HAD FAILED TO OPEN CAUSED BY A FAULTY VERSA VALVE (NV-105B).  THE FAULT WAS IMMEDIATELY CLEARED AND CORRECTED IN THE PLC WITH CORRECT LOGIC, AND THE VERSA VALVE WAS REPLACED.    THIS EVENT DOES NOT MEET THE INCIDENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS DEFINED IN 49 CFR 191.3.1(I), 191.3.1(II), 191.3.1(III), OR 191.3.  THIS INCIDENT REPORT HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED AT THE REQUEST OF PHMSA SOUTHWEST REGION DUE TO A CALL FROM A LOCAL RESIDENT WHO LIVES CLOSE TO THE KATY GAS STORAGE FACILITY.     THE TOTAL RELEASE TIME WAS  APPROXIMATELY 40 SECONDS WITH AN ESTIMATED RELEASE VOLUME OF 197,000 SCF OF NATURAL GAS."

(A -F) SECTIONS OF THE REPORT FROM 01/10/15 - 01/14/15.    LISTED BELOW IS THE SUMMARY OF EVENTS:     12.14.14, OUR EMPLOYEES NOTED A SMALL SHEEN AND BUBBLES. GIVEN ITS PROXIMITY TO A PRODUCER SATELLITE FACILITY WE BELIEVED IT TO BE THEIR ISSUE, HOWEVER UPON HAVING THE COORDINATES PLOTTED OUT IT LOOKED TO BE ON OUR 26"" LINE. WE STARTED THE PROCESS OF ISOLATING THE SEGMENT BETWEEN SMI 33 AND VR 149 WHILE WE SOURCED A DSV TO INVESTIGATE FOR US. WE SPOKE TO THE USCG THE PREVIOUS EVENING ABOUT THIS AND JUST UPDATED THEM, AS WELL AS NOTIFYING THE NRC.  12.15.14, OUR FLIGHT REPORTED THAT THE LEAK AND ASSOCIATED SHEEN WERE AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WITH NO APPRECIABLE CHANGE. WE CONTINUED TO DISCUSS OPTIONS WITH DSV PROVIDERS. PRESSURE MONITORING WAS ONGOING WITH LITTLE DEVIATION NOTED. THE USCG WAS UPDATED AS TO STATUS.  12.16.14, WE LOCATED A DSV. THE SHEEN WAS STILL PRESENT BUT ONLY 1/4 MILE LONG AND WAS ENCOUNTERING A CHANGING CURRENT AND CHOPPY SEAS. WE GAVE THE USCG THEIR DAILY UPDATE.  12.17.14, THE DSV MADE IT TO THE SITE. INITIAL REPORT WAS THAT THEY LOCATED THE LEAK SOURCE VIA PROBE WITH APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET OF COVER. THEY CONFIRMED THE PIPE SIZE AS OUR 26'. THERE WAS NO REPORTED CHANGE TO THE LEAK ITSELF AT THE TIME.  12.18.14, OVERNIGHT WE WERE ABLE TO LOWER THE LINE PRESSURE AND BEGAN REMOVING CONCRETE AND MASTIC IN THE EARLY HOURS. IT APPEARED AT THE TIME TO BE A PIN HOLE LEAK. DIVERS CONTINUED TO CLEAN UP THE AREA TO OBTAIN THE VARIOUS UT AND CP READINGS NEEDED.    12.19.14, WE COMPLETED ALL PREP WORK ON THE PIPELINE AND CONFIRMED THAT A LEAK CLAMP WOULD BE OUR REPAIR METHOD. DUE TO THE INCREASING SEAS AND THE RISK OF A VESSEL TO VESSEL TRANSFER OF THE CLAMP, THE DSV WENT TO DOCK TO PICK UP THE CLAMP AND EQUIPMENT.  12.21.14, THE CLAMP WAS INSTALLED AND ALL LEAK CHECKS WENT WELL. WE WERE UNABLE TO FLY TO ALLOW PRODUCERS BACK ON AND RETURN THE LINE TO NORMAL SERVICE DUE TO WEATHER.  12.22.14, WEATHER FINALLY CLEARED UP. WE MADE AN OVER FLIGHT TO THE SMI 33 FACILITY, SEEING NO SIGNS OF LEAKAGE WHILE IN ROUTE. THE SMI 33 FACILITY WAS THEN PLACED INTO NORMAL SERVICE. THE HELICOPTER MADE STOPS AT THE LOCKED PRODUCER FACILITIES AND PLACED THEM IN NORMAL OPERATIONS."

THE DEVICE WAS DISCOVERED ABOVE TWO BURIED PIPELINES (A PG&E NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE AND A MOJAVE WATER DISTRICT PIPELINE) AND THE PIPELINE ROUTE WAS CLEARLY MARKED AS SHARED BY PG&E AND THE MOJAVE WATER DISTRICT. THE PG&E EMPLOYEE MOVED THE DEVICE ABOUT 2,000 FEET ALONG THE ROAD, TO A LOCATION ABOVE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY SHARED BY PG&E AND THE KINDER MORGAN COMPANY, PRIOR TO REPORTING THE DEVICE TO HIS SUPERVISOR.  THE SUPERVISOR THEN REPORTED THE MATTER TO PG&E'S CORPORATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT AND THE SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PATROL DEPUTY ARRIVED ON SCENE AT APPROXIMATELY 0930 HOURS.  UPON SEEING THE DEVICE, THE DEPUTY ESTABLISHED A ONE MILE PERIMETER AROUND THE DEVICE'S LOCATION, INSTRUCTED HINKLEY COMPRESSOR STATION EMPLOYEES TO SHELTER IN PLACE, AND CALLED THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT BOMB SQUAD.  PG&E'S CORPORATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT DISPATCHED AN INVESTIGATOR TO THE SCENE WHO ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH HINKLEY COMPRESSOR STATION AND SAN BERNARDINO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT.  BOMB SQUAD PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 1300 HOURS.  THE BOMB SQUAD EXAMINED THE DEVICE, THEN REMOVED IT TO A SAFE AREA NEARBY AND RENDERED IT SAFE AT APPROXIMATELY 1345 HOURS.   PG&E'S CORPORATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT WAS ADVISED SHORTLY THEREAFTER THAT THE SHERIFF'S BOMB TECHNICIANS DECLARED IT WAS A FUNCTIONAL DEVICE, WHICH COULD HAVE EXPLODED IF IT HAD AN OUTSIDE POWER SOURCE, WHICH IT LACKED.  THE DEVICE WAS DESCRIBED AS A PVC PIPE, ABOUT TWO INCHES IN DIAMETER, SEVERAL INCHES LONG, WITH END CAPS ATTACHED.   THE SAN BERNARDINO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ADVISED THE DEVICE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO AFFECT THE PIPES HAD IT EXPLODED ABOVE THEM.  CORPORATE SECURITY COMMUNICATED THE DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT TO THE TRANSPORTATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION AND THE RIVERSIDE RESIDENT AGENCY OFFICE OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.   FROM DECEMBER 10 TO 11, PG&E RE-INSPECTED THE PIPELINE L-314 ROUTE, ALONG WITH OTHER PG&E PIPELINE ROUTES IN THE AREA, TO LOOK FOR OTHER DEVICES.  NO OTHER DEVICES WERE DISCOVERED.  THERE WAS NO RELEASE OF GAS, NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES, NO MAJOR MEDIA ON SCENE AND DAMAGES ARE LESS THAN $50,000.  NO CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCED GAS SERVICE INTERRUPTION AND NO GAS FACILITIES WERE SHUT DOWN.  THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORT TO CPUC AND DOT BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE EVENT.    (PLEASE NOTE THAT THE RESPONSES TO PART E, QUESTIONS 5A, 5B, AND 5C OF THIS PHMSA 7100 REPORT ARE MERELY PLACEHOLDERS AND DO NOT APPLY SINCE THERE WAS NO RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS.

THE LEAK WAS REPORTED TO ANR, OPERATOR FOR TC OFFSHORE, AS A BUBBLING PATTERN APPROXIMATELY TWO FEET IN DIAMETER OVER TC OFFSHORE'S 733 TRANSMISSION PIPELINE AT APPROXIMATE MILEPOST 40.8 (29.24206280, -91.50513440).    FOLLOWING THE REPORT OF THE INCIDENT TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, TRANSCANADA/ANR MAINTAINED CONTACT AND UPDATED REGULARLY U.S. COAST GUARD, BSEE, AND PHMSA.    WHILE PREPARING TO DISPATCH AN INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR VESSEL TO THE SITE, ANR SCHEDULED AERIAL PATROLS TWICE DAILY TO MONITOR THE LEAK.  NO SHEEN OR PRODUCT WAS DOCUMENTED AT THE SITE FOR THE DURATION OF THE LEAK AND REPAIR.    THE REPAIR VESSEL AND CONTRACT EMPLOYEES ARRIVED AT THE INCIDENT LOCATION ON 3 DECEMBER TO BEGIN EXPOSING THE PIPE FOR THE LEAK INVESTIGATION.  COVER MATERIAL JETTING AND CONCRETE REMOVAL AT THE LEAK SITE WAS COMPLETED ON 8 DECEMBER.  OBSERVATION AND INVESTIGATION BY THE DIVERS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS LOCATED AT THE TWELVE O'CLOCK POSITION IN THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM 45 INCHES DOWNSTREAM OF A GIRTH WELD.  DURING THE COVER MATERIAL REMOVAL, ULTRASONIC TESTS TO DETERMINE THE POSSIBILITY OF METAL LOSS WERE CONDUCTED ON THE PIPELINE AT TWO LOCATIONS UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF LEAK AREA.  THESE TESTS INDICATED NO METAL LOSS TO THE PIPELINE.    UPON DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK LOCATION, ANR DECIDED TO ISOLATE THE PIPELINE SEGMENT, REDUCE THE PRESSURE ON THE LINE, AND PERFORM ADDITIONAL TESTING AND ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE MOST EFFECTIVE REPAIR.      ON 13 DECEMBER, SUBSEA VALVE 733-1A-2 LOCATED AT EUGENE ISLAND BLOCK 63 (EI-63) WAS CLOSED,  ISOLATING THE 733 PIPELINE BETWEEN EI-63  AND ANR'S PATTERSON COMPRESSOR STATION LOCATED  IN ST. MARY PARISH, LOUISIANA.  ADDITIONALLY, THE PRODUCER, CASTEX, WAS SHUT-IN AND THE VALVE WAS CLOSED AT EUGENE ISLAND BLOCK 18.  PRESSURE ON THE 733 LINE WAS REDUCED FROM APPROXIMATELY 800 PSIG TO 400 PSIG AND FLARED AT THE PATTERSON COMPRESSOR STATION.      FOLLOWING THE REDUCTION IN PRESSURE, TIME OF FLIGHT DIFFRACTION NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING (NDT) WAS CONDUCTED ON 15 DECEMBER 2014 TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND LOCATION OF LEAK.   THE AREA INSPECTED INCLUDED ONE FOOT UPSTREAM AND ONE FOOT DOWNSTREAM OF THE ANOMALY AREA.  TESTING INDICATED A SMALL DEFECT LOCATED WITHIN THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM WITH NO INDICATION OF CRACKS OR LACK OF FUSION.      ON 18 DECEMBER AT 05:00 CST, A PLIDCO BOLT-ON CLAMP WAS SUCCESSFULLY INSTALLED OVER THE LEAK LOCATION BY QUALIFIED CONTRACT EMPLOYEES.  THE CLAMP IS CONSIDERED A PERMANENT REPAIR.  FOLLOWING THE INSTALLATION OF THE CLAMP, PIPELINE PRESSURE WAS INCREASED, THE PRODUCER VALVE AT EI-18 WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME FLOWING, AND THE SUBSEA VALVE AT EI-63 WILL BE REOPENED WHEN IT CAN BE SAFELY ACCESSED.  THERE WERE NO INDICATIONS OF FURTHER LEAKAGE AT THE REPAIR LOCATION."

UPDATE APRIL 10, 2015 - PIPE WAS SENT TO LAB FOR METALLUGIC REVIEW, COMPLETED REPORT RECEIVED APRIL 2, 2015. STRESS ENGINEERING'S TEST RESULTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: VISUAL, METALLOGRAPHIC, AND FRACTOGRAPHIC EXAMINATION OF THE SAMPLE INDICATED THAT CRACKS INITIATED ON THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF THE PIPE. THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE CRACKS INCLUDED CLOSELY-SPACED CRACKS IN COLONIES, TRANSGRANULAR AND BRANCHED GROWTH PATH, CRESCENT-SHAPED CRACKS PARTIALLY COVERED WITH MAGNETITE, AND ENLARGEMENT OF THE CRACKS AT THE OUTSIDE SURFACE DUE TO CORROSION. THESE FEATURES SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS LEAK WAS THE RESULT OF NEAR-NEUTRAL PH STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC). THESE CRACKS WERE ALIGNED PERPENDICULAR TO THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS OF THE PIPE AT THE EXTRADOS OF AN OVER-BEND AND WERE CREATED BY BENDING LOADS IN THE PIPELINE. THE FACT THAT THE FINAL FAILURE WAS DUE TO DUCTILE OVERLOAD ALSO SUPPORTS THE ASSERTION THAT THE LONGITUDINAL STRESSES WERE SIGNIFICANT AT THIS LOCATION. FURTHER, THE UPWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PIPE AFTER IT WAS CUT IN THE DITCH DURING EXCAVATION IS CONFORMATION OF THIS CONCLUSION. STRESS ENGINEERING DID NOT OBSERVE ANY MATERIAL FLAWS OR DEFECTS IN THE SAMPLE MATERIAL. THE MICROSTRUCTURE OF THE SAMPLE IS TYPICAL FOR A CARBON-STEEL PIPE MATERIAL. THE PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIAL ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF API 5LX (1968) FOR GRADE X60 AND ARE NOT BELIEVED TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE.    9/23/2015 ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON THE ILI DATA TO LOOK FOR SIMILAR CONDITIONS IN THE LINE SEGMENT AND THESE AREAS WERE OVERLAID WITH CIS DATA.  THREE (3) LOCATIONS WERE SELECTED TO INVESTIGATE, THEY WILL DUG PRIOR TO THE END OF OCTOBER."

THIS CS IS OWNED, OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY COLUMBIA.  WHILE THE RV WAS STILL RELIEVING MATERIAL, THE 2-IN PIPELINE THAT THIS RV WAS INSTALLED ON WAS BROKEN.    THIS STAND-OFF STEEL PIPE IS OF 2-IN DIAMETER WITH A WALL THICKNESS OF .218-IN. WAS FOUND BROKEN-OFF AT ITS LOWER SECTION (CLOSE TO THE PIPELINE THIS RV IS PROTECTING) AND SEPARATING THE RV FROM ITS PIPE.  THE BROKEN 2-IN PIPE WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO A METALLURGICAL INVESTIGATION FAILURE CONSULTANT FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS AND INVESTIGATION.    PRIOR TO THE MATERIAL RELEASE, THE CS UNITS WERE SHUT DOWN AS FLOW FROM THE STORAGE FIELD WAS NOT REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN CUSTOMER DEMAND. WHEN THIS OCCURS, DEPENDING ON STORAGE VOLUME, THE PIPELINE PRESSURE GRADUALLY INCREASED UP TO THE PREVAILING STORAGE FIELD WELL PRESSURE. AT THE TIME, THE COMPRESSOR STATION PIPING AND VALVING WAS CONFIGURED TO ALLOW THIS PRESSURE RISE INTO THE CS SUCTION PIPING WHICH HAS TWO RELIEF VALVES SET AT 720 PSIG. ONE RV ACTUATED AND VENTED AS INTENDED; AND KEPT THE SUCTION PIPING PRESSURE FROM INCREASING FURTHER.  RESULTS OF METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT THE CAUSE OF THE 2-IN DIAMETER PIPE FAILURE WAS FATIGUE AS A RESULT OF CYCLIC BENDING.  AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE TO PREVENT THE CHAIN OF EVENTS FROM RE-OCCURING IN THE FUTURE, A SUPPORT WAS INTRODUCED TO THE RV-PIPE ASSEMBLY WHERE IT WILL DIS-ALLOW THE RV VENT STACK FROM SWAYING, HENCE, DAMPENING THE CYCLIC EFFECT THAT LED TO THIS INCIDENT.  SIMILAR INSTALLATION WAS APPLIED ON A SIMILAR APPLICATION WITHIN THE SAME FACILITY."

EMMET TEAM PERSONNEL CONTACTED MR. GRADY TO DETERMINE THE LOCATION AND SITUATION.  ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE CALLED OUT TO ASSIST WITH RESPONDING TO THE LEAK.  AT 18:14, EMMET TEAM PERSONNEL CONFIRMED THAT LINE AM-153 WAS LEAKING GAS.  THE SITE OF THE LEAK WAS REPORTED TO BE AT GPS COORDINATES -93.36972716 W, 34.01297563 N.  THE SITE OF THE LEAK WAS APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES WEST ALONG THE PIPELINE FROM THE OKOLONA CITY LIMITS IN SECTION 29 TOWNSHIP 8S AND RANGE 22W OF CLARK COUNTY.  THE LEAK WAS LATER DETERMINED TO BE AT STATION 695+18 ON LINE AM-153.  THE PIPELINE WAS MARKED WITH CARSONITE MARKERS AND BURIED APPROXIMATELY 30 INCHES DEEP AT THE LEAK SITE.  ADDITIONAL SIGNS WERE ADDED ONCE REPAIR WAS MADE.   MR. GRADY TOLD EMMET TEAM PERSONNEL THAT HE WAS OPERATING THE BULLDOZER SUB-CULTIVATING THE PROPERTY FOR THE LANDOWNER IN PREPARATION FOR REPLANTING OF TREES.  HE STATED THAT HE HAD NOT NOTIFIED 811 ARKANSAS ONE CALL PRIOR TO STARTING HIS WORK.  ARKANSAS ONE CALL PERSONNEL CONFIRMED THAT NO REQUEST TO LOCATE UNDERGROUND UTILITIES WAS RECEIVED WHEN THEY SEARCHED THEIR RECORDS FOR THE HARETOWN ROAD AREA IN CLARK COUNTY.  BECAUSE THE LOCAL TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE HIGH 30S AND EXPECTED TO DROP DURING THE NIGHT INTO THE 20S, A PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO TEMPORARILY STOP THE LEAK AND MAKE PERMANENT REPAIRS DURING THE NEXT DAY.  ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE CALLED OUT TO MONITOR LINE PRESSURES AT THE AM-153 TAKE-OFF FROM LINE S NEAR GURDON AND THE END OF AM-153 NEAR DELIGHT.  EQUIPMENT AND A TEMPORARY REPAIR SLEEVE WERE BROUGHT FROM THE EMMET OFFICE.  AN EMERGENCY EXCAVATION NOTICE WAS GIVEN TO ARKANSAS ONE CALL ABOUT THE IMPENDING EXCAVATION NEAR THE LINE AM-153 LEAK, TICKET # AR14114-0908.    THE INSTALLATION OF THE STYLE 96 BOLT-ON REPAIR SLEEVE OVER THE LEAKING PIPE WAS STARTED.  AT 00:15 ON SATURDAY 11/15/2014, EMMET TEAM PERSONNEL COMPLETED THE INSTALLATION AND NOTIFIED SYSTEM CONTROL THAT THE LEAK WAS STOPPED.  THE LINE PRESSURE AT DELIGHT WAS OBSERVED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1 PSIG.  SYSTEM CONTROL PROVIDED LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WITH UPDATED STATUS REPORTS ABOUT THE AM-153 LEAK.  DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE TEMPORARY LEAK REPAIR, LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY EXPERIENCED THE LOSS OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO 5 OR 6 HOMES.  DISTRIBUTION PERSONNEL CLOSED OFF THE DELIGHT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT THE TOWN BORDER STATION DUE TO A CONCERN ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PILOT LIGHTS EXTINGUISHING AND OF ESCAPING GAS.  NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SERVICE WAS STOPPED TO APPROXIMATELY 200 CUSTOMERS.  AFTER SUNRISE ON 11/15/2014, A CONTRACTOR WAS MOBILIZED.  REPAIR MATERIALS INCLUDING PRE-TESTED PIPE, FITTINGS AND STOPPLES WERE BROUGHT TO THE LEAK SITE.  SYSTEM CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED OF THE REPAIR WORK THAT WOULD OCCUR.  EXCAVATION FOR THE REPAIR INSTALLATION BEGAN AT 09:49.  TWO STOPPLES AND A BY-PASS PIPE WERE INSTALLED TO REPLACE THE DAMAGE SECTION OF PIPE.  WELDS WERE CHECKED.  THE NEW PIPING WAS SUCCESSFULLY LEAK TESTED FROM 13:30 TO 14:00.  THE STOPPLES WERE TAPPED TO ALLOW GAS TO FLOW AROUND THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE.  THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH WELD CAPS.  AT 19:18 ON 11/15/2014, SYSTEM CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE PERMANENT REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED.  DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE PERMANENT LEAK REPAIR, THE TOWN BORDER STATION AT DELIGHT WAS REOPENED TO PROVIDE NATURAL GAS TO THE DELIGHT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  SGO ASSEMBLED APPROXIMATELY 20 TECHNICIANS TO RELIGHT PILOTS AND RESTORE NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS IN DELIGHT."

AN INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE METER STRAINER WAS FILLED WITH DEBRIS LIKELY FROM A CONSTRUCTION PROJECT TO REPLACE THE RELIEF VALVE AT THE STATION IN MAY OF 2014.  THE REGULATOR DID NOT LOCK-UP FAST ENOUGH WHEN THE FLOW DECREASED AND THE PRESSURE WAS ABLE TO BUILD UP BETWEEN THE REGULATOR AND STRAINER TO REACH THE SET POINT OF THE RELIEF VALVE.

NO INJURIES OR PUBLIC DAMAGE RESULTED FROM THIS INCIDENT.     ALL CUSTOMERS WHOSE SERVICES WERE INTERRUPTED HAVE BEEN RESTORED.     INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT SHOWED THAT THE REGULATOR STATION SUPPLYING GAS TO THE AFFECTED CUSTOMERS WAS FED FROM TWO GAS TRANSMISSION LINES (LINE 235 AND LINE 335). FURTHER INVESTIGATION SHOWED A PIN OFF TEE ON THE TRANSMISSION LINE AND INSTRUMENTATION DIAGRAM OF LINE 235 FEEDING THE SUPPLY LINE TO THE REGULATOR STATION.  A PIN OFF TEE IS NORMALLY BURIED IN THE OPEN (PIN RAISED POSITION) AND CANNOT BE OPERATED (PIN LOWERED) UNLESS EXCAVATED TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE PIN BY REMOVING A CAP ON THE PIN OFF TEE.  THERE WAS NO PIN OFF TEE ON LINE 235 AND THE SUPPLY LINE TO THE REGULATOR STATION WAS ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO LINE 235 WITH A CLOSED CURB VALVE TEE INSTEAD. WHEN THE LINE 335 FEED WAS ISOLATED AND DEPRESSURIZED, THE FEED TO THE REGULATOR STATION WAS LOST RESULTING IN GAS OUTAGES. INITIALLY WHEN THE LINE 235 VALVE WAS CLOSED, THAT PIPELINE WAS NOT BLOWN DOWN AND THE VALVE BYPASSED ENOUGH THAT UPON CHECKING THE INLET FEED TO THE REGULATOR STATION IT APPEARED THE LINE 235 PIN OFF TEE WAS OPEN.

HOFFMAN	MANAGER	(304)357-2548	mikehoffman@cpg.com	"ON OCTOBER 15, 2014, A CONTRACTOR EMPLOYED BY COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA) WAS WORKING ON A NEAR-BY PROJECT, WHEN HE DETECTED THE ODOR OF NATURAL GAS.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS, A CASING VENT WAS TESTED FOR EVIDENCE OF A NON-HAZARDOUS NATURAL GAS LEAK INSIDE A CASING.  OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE NOTIFIED TO ASSIST IN SECURING THE SITE PENDING FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND NECESSARY SAFETY MEASURES.  THE SEGMENT WAS ISOLATED BY COLUMBIA PERSONNEL AND THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN.  HENCE, THE SITE WAS SECURED.  UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION, A DECISION WAS MADE TO REPLACE THE CASING AND THE PIPE WITH A PIPE.   UPON REMOVAL OF THE PIPE, AN EXTERNAL CORROSION PIT WITH 100 PERCENT WALL PENETRATION WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE CAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED NATURAL GAS RELEASE. THE CORROSION PIT WAS APPROXIMATELY 3.75 INCHES INSIDE OF THE NORTH END OF THE CASING AT THE 5 O'CLOCK POSITION WHEN FACING NORTH. THE PIT WAS AT A LOCATION OF DAMAGED OR MISSING COATING.  THE DAMAGED COATING WAS LOCATED UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR.  BOTH RUBBER ISOLATORS AND WOODEN CENTRALIZERS WERE OBSERVED TO BE IN USE UPON REMOVAL OF THE CASING. HOWEVER, THE CARRIER PIPE WAS NOT CENTERED THROUGH THE CASING. WATER MARKS WERE OBSERVED ON BOTH THE CARRIER PIPE AND ON THE CASING, INDICATING THAT THE CASING SEALS HAD BEEN COMPROMISED AND, AT TIMES, WATER HAD BEEN PRESENT IN THE ANNULAR SPACE. WATER FLOWED OUT OF THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CASING WHEN THE SOUTH SIDE CASING SEAL WAS EXPOSED.  NO KNOWN SOIL CONDITIONS OR MEASURED POTENTIAL READINGS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH MICROBIOLOGICALLY INFLUENCED CORROSION OR CATHODIC PROTECTION INTERFERENCE WERE OBSERVED.  1. THE EXTERNAL CORROSION PIT OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF CORROSION AT THE SITE OF COATING DAMAGE UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CASING.  2. THE COATING DAMAGE LIKELY OCCURRED DURING INSTALLATION OF THE CASING OR DURING A SUBSEQUENT EXCAVATION OF THE CASING ENDS.  THE WOODEN CENTRALIZERS CAUSED AND/OR EXACERBATED THE COATING DAMAGE.  3. THE PLACEMENT OF THE CASING ISOLATOR OVER THE AREA OF DAMAGED COATING DID NOT ISOLATE THE EXPOSED STEEL FROM EVENTUAL ELECTROLYTE INTRUSION.  WITH WATER BEING PRESENT BETWEEN THE CASING SEAL AND THE PIPE, ATMOSPHERIC AND CREVICE CORROSION PITTED THE PIPE TO CAUSE THE LEAK. 4. THE INTRODUCTION OF WATER AS AN ELECTROLYTE TO THE EXPOSED STEEL CREATED A LOCALIZED CORROSION CELL UNDER THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR.  EXTERNAL CORROSION OCCURRED WHEN THE NON-LEVEL CASING FILLED WITH WATER COMPLETELY TO THE NORTH (HIGH) SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION OCCURRED WHEN THE CASING WAS NOT COMPLETELY FILLED.  5. DURING THE TIME WHEN THE CASING WAS COMPLETELY FILLED WITH WATER, THE RUBBER CASING ISOLATOR SHIELDED THE EXPOSED STEEL FROM CATHODIC PROTECTION CURRENT THAT COULD HAVE MITIGATED THE CORROSION CELL DURING THAT TIME.  DURING THE TIME WHEN ATMOSPHERIC CORROSION WAS OCCURRING, ONLY RE-COATING THE EXPOSED STEEL OR MAINTAINING DRY CONDITIONS INSIDE THE CASING COULD HAVE MITIGATED THE CORROSION CELL.  KEY LESSONS LEARNED/CORRECTIVE MEASURES: 1) THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF THE CORROSION PIT THAT CAUSED THE LEAK MAKES IT DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE, TO DETECT DURING TYPICAL, NON-EXCAVATION CASING POTENTIAL OR SHORT TESTS.  BECAUSE THE CORROSION OCCURRED IN AN ELECTRICALLY SHIELDED AREA, THE ONLY RELIABLE METHOD FOR DETECTION IS THE USE OF IN-LINE INSPECTION TOOLS.  LINE R-701-N IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING RECONFIGURED FOR THE PURPOSE OF RUNNING IN-LINE INSPECTION TOOLS IN THE FUTURE.  2) THERE WERE NO INDICATORS FOR A LOW PIPE-TO-SOIL POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS FOR THE PIPELINE IN THE AREA GOING BACK TO 2008.  LIKEWISE, NO CASING-TO-SOIL POTENTIAL MEASUREMENTS INDICATED SHORT TESTING WAS NEEDED.  3) FILLING THE ANNULAR SPACE BETWEEN THE CARRIER PIPE AND THE CASING WITH A DIELECTRIC MATERIAL REMOVES THE CORROSIVE ENVIRONMENT AND CAN PREVENT CORROSION FROM OCCURRING.  FILLING OF THIS CASING COULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS LEAK."

THERE WERE NO INJURIES; HOWEVER, THERE WAS ONE SELF-EVACUATION OF A RESIDENT CLOSEST TO THE SITE AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. THE RELEASE OCCURRED IN A RURAL AREA AND WITHIN A PASTURE. THE CLOSEST STRUCTURE INTENDED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY IS ABOUT 500 FEET NORTHWEST (LANDOWNER RESIDENCE). THIS STRUCTURE WAS UNDAMAGED; HOWEVER A BARN LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 221 FEET TO THE NORTHWEST HAD MINOR DAMAGE FROM FLYING DEBRIS. THE RELEASE APPEARED TO HAVE INITIATED BY PIPE MOVEMENT OUT OF THE MECHANICAL DRESSER COUPLINGS. THE PIPE SEGMENT INVOLVED DOES NOT CONTAIN AN HCA. THE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE RELEASE WAS 441 PSIG AT THE LOUISBURG 105 GATE; THE MAOP OF THIS SEGMENT IS 475 PSIG. GAS CONTROL ALARMS ACCOMPANIED BY A COINCIDENT CALL FROM JOHNSON COUNTY 911 SET IN MOTION A RESPONSE BY LOCAL EMPLOYEES WHICH HAD THE AFFECTED SEGMENT ISOLATED ON THE UPSTREAM (105 GATE) AND DOWNSTREAM (106 GATE) SIDES BY APPROXIMATELY 11:25 AM.

THIS SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT UPDATES THE PART G APPARENT CAUSE BASED ON THE ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS.   THE DIRECT CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT SHOULD BE CATEGORIZED AS A CONSTRUCTION FAILURE. THE PIPE WAS CONSTRUCTED IN 1931 WITH AN OVER BEND AT THE COUPLING THAT EXCEEDED THE COUPLING MANUFACTURER DEFLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS. THE PIPE DISENGAGED AT THE COUPLING DUE TO THAT DEFLECTION EXCEEDANCE COMBINED WITH AN UPWARD COMPONENT FORCE DUE TO INTERNAL PRESSURE. ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR WAS INADEQUATE RESISTIVE FORCES ON THE PIPE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN SOIL PROPERTIES DUE TO WATER SATURATION.

THE ELECTROMAGNET (EM) DISTURBANCES IN THE UV AND IR RANGE TRIPPED THE HEAT AND LIGHT FLASH SENSORS AT THE STATION RESULTING IN THE ESD.  THE MANUFACTURE OF THE UV/IR SENSOR WAS CONTACTED TO DETERMINE IF THE SENSORS CAN BE ADJUSTED TO AVOID  EM DISTURBANCES FROM LIGHTNING EVENTS AS DISCUSSED BELOW.      NGPL OPERATIONS INSPECTED AND INVESTIGATED OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE SENSITIVITY OF THE STATION UV/IR SENSORS THAT CAUSED THE STATION 388 EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (ESD) BACK ON OCTOBER 12, 2014.  AFTER SUBMITTAL OF THE INITIAL REPORT, NGPL DETERMINED THE DIP SWITCH SETTINGS HAVE A FACTORY DEFAULT 4 SECOND DELAY BETWEEN THE WARNING AND ALARM.  IN ADDITION, NGPL DETERMINED THAT NO OTHER EQUIPMENT INSTALLED ON THIS SYSTEM WOULD IMPACT THE FACTORY-DEFAULT DELAY SETTINGS AND, UPON VERIFYING THE  UV/IR SYSTEM DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY TYPE OF POWER OUTAGE OR SURGE, THE SENSOR SIGNAL DELAY SETTINGS WERE INCREASED FROM FOUR (4) SECONDS TO EIGHT (8) SECONDS.  NGPL BELIEVES THAT INCREASING THE TIME DELAY SETTING WILL REDUCE FALSE ALARMS AND SHUTDOWNS CAUSED BY SEVERE LIGHTNING STORMS GOING FORWARD.      NGPL'S NORTH LANSING STORAGE FIELD HAS A MAXIMUM PEAK-DAY WITHDRAWAL RATE OF 1,240 MMCF PER DAY AND THE COMPRESSOR STATION NO. 388 NEAR LONGVIEW, TEXAS IS COMPRISED OF SEVEN COMPRESSOR UNITS TOTALING 36,000 HP, TWO CO2 EXTRACTION PLANTS AND FOUR DEHYDRATOR SKIDS.  THE NORMAL ESD RESTORATION PROCESS CAN TAKE UP TO THREE (3) HOURS OR MORE DEPENDING ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES.  FOLLOWING AN ESD EVENT WHERE THE CAUSE REMAINS UNKNOWN, CONSIDERABLY MORE TIME IS REQUIRED TO VERIFY THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE EVENT, TO CONFIRM THAT SAFETY DEVICES FUNCTIONED AS DESIGNED, AND THAT NO DAMAGE TO THE FACILITIES RESULTED BEFORE RESTARTING THE FACILITIES.  ON OCTOBER 12, 2014, IT TOOK NGPL APPROXIMATELY FIVE (5) HOURS TO VERIFY THE CAUSE OF THE ESD AND DETERMINE THAT NO DAMAGE EXISTED TO ANY OF THE FACILITIES BEFORE BRINGING THE ENTIRE STATION BACK INTO SERVICE.

SCHRIEVER OPERATIONS RECEIVED A PHONE CALL FROM PILOTS AT HELIPORT SAYING ONE OF THEIR HELICOPTERS FLYING FOR ANOTHER COMPANY HAD REPORTED SOME BUBBLES IN THE SS 47 AREA NEAR OUR 26"".  THE COORDINATES GIVEN WERE PLOTTED AND WERE SHOWN TO BE 1200+ FEET WEST OF WILLIAMS 26"" PIPELINE.  ONE OF OUR OWN HELICOPTERS WITH WILLIAMS PERSONNEL ON BOARD DEPARTED SCHRIEVER HELIPORT A FEW MINUTES LATER FOR NORMAL OPERATIONS WERE ASKED TO FLY OVER REPORTED BUBBLES TO VERIFY COORDINATES.  WILLIAMS PERSONNEL ON BOARD HELICOPTER CALLED SCHRIEVER OFFICE AT 11:22AM WITH THEIR OWN COORDINATES OF BUBBLES AND VERIFIED TO SCHRIEVER COM THAT BUBBLES AND VERY LIGHT & SMALL SHEEN APPEARED TO BE RIGHT ON TOP OF WILLIAMS 26"".  THE NEW COORDINATES WERE PLOTTED, PLACING THE BUBBLES RIGHT ON TOP OF WILLIAMS 26"" PIPELINE, AGREEING WITH WILLIAMS PERSONNEL OPINION.  AT 11:35AM, O'BRIEN'S WAS CONTACTED BY WARREN TOUPS.  O'BRIEN'S CONTACTED NRC AT 11:50AM; RECEIVED NRC# 1097722.  O'BRIEN'S ALSO CONTACTED LA. STATE POLICE AT 11:56AM, RECEIVED STATE NUMBER 14-04526.

THE OPERATOR EMPLOYEE QUICKLY IDENTIFIED THE FAILURE LOCATION AND IMMEDIATELY ISOLATED THE PIPELINE SECTION THAT FAILED. FIELD EXAMINATION OF THE FAILURE INDICATED A PIPE SEAM FAILURE.   ANALYSIS OF THE CORROSION CHARACTERISTICS AND RECOVERED SLUDGE SAMPLE, AND REVIEW OF THE GAS COMPOSITION INDICATES THAT THE MOST LIKELY CAUSE OF THE INTERNAL CORROSION WAS EXPOSURE TO LOW PH BRINE.  THE LOW PH BRINE WAS MOST LIKELY CAUSED BY WELL ACIDIZING FLUID.  PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION WAS COMPLETED BY JULY 27, 2015. THE NEW PIPELINE WAS PUT BACK IN SERVICE ON  OCTOBER 7, 2015."

OWT PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1130 HOURS AND OBSERVED GAS BUBBLING UP IN WATER STANDING OVER THE PIPELINE.  THE LOCATION IS VERY RURAL WITH AN OIL FIELD LEASE ROAD BRIDGE CROSSING THE RIVER ABOUT 150 FEET NORTH OF THE OWT PIPELINE.  THERE WAS NO FIRE OR EXPLOSION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RELEASE.  RECENT FLOODING AND CONTINUED RAIN IN THE AREA PREVENTED IMMEDIATE DIRECT ACCESS TO THE LEAKING SECTION OF PIPELINE.  THE LINE SEGMENT WAS SHUT IN AND PRESSURE IN THE 17.5 MILE SEGMENT WAS REDUCED IMMEDIATELY UPON DISCOVERY OF THE LEAK.  A POSITIVE PRESSURE IS BEING MAINTAINED ON THE ISOLATED SEGMENT TO KEEP WATER AND SILT OUT OF THE PIPELINE UNTIL PERSONNEL CAN SAFELY ASSESS THE PIPELINE.  THE PIPELINE LEAK WILL BE ASSESSED AND REPAIRED ONCE THE FLOOD WATERS HAVE SUBSIDED.  THIS WILL HOPEFULLY TO START SOON, PENDING SITE ACCESSIBILITY WITH EQUIPMENT.    THIS INCIDENT REPORT WAS NOT FILED WITHIN THE 30 DAYS OF THE LEAK DISCOVERY AS IT WAS NOT EXPECTED TO MEET THE REPORTABLE INCIDENT CRITERIA AT THAT TIME.  ONCE ACCESS TO THE SITE IMPROVED, A BETTER ESTIMATE FOR REPAIR WAS ESTABLISHED.  THE NEW COST ESTIMATE IS MORE THAN $50,000 SO THIS INCIDENT REPORT IS BEING FILED.  THIS INCIDENT REPORT IS MISSING INFORMATION THAT CAN ONLY BE DETERMINED ONCE THE LEAK IS ACCESSED AND REPAIRED.  IT WILL BE UPDATED ONCE THE PIPE AND THE LEAK HAVE BEEN EVALUATED.      UPDATE:  THE LEAK WAS FINALLY ACCESSIBLE ON DECEMBER 8TH, 2014.  EXCAVATION VIA HYDROVAC EXPOSED THE PIPELINE AND THE AREA OF THE LEAK.  A 0.100' PIN HOLE WAS LOCATED AT THE 7 O'CLOCK POSITION OF THE PIPE.  THE 17.57 MILE ISOLATED SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS BLOWN DOWN AND CONTRACTOR COMPLETED EXCAVATION ON DECEMBER 9TH, 2014.  APPROXIMATELY 115' OF THE PIPELINE WAS CUT OUT ON DECEMBER 10TH, 2014 AND NEW 12.75' OD X-42 0.250' WT FBE ERW PIPE WAS INSTALLED ON DECEMBER 10TH AND 11TH.

PLAGGE DID NOT HAVE A ONE-CALL TICKET AND NO UNDERGROUND UTILITIES WERE MARKED.  THE TILING MACHINE PUNCTURED THE 4-INCH CREATING A HOLE ABOUT 2 INCHES LONG BY 1 INCH WIDE. THE PLOW TOOTH STUCK IN THE PIPE PROVIDED SOME LEAK STOPPAGE EFFECTS. THIS ALLOWED NORTHERN TO PROCEED SLOWLY AND DELIBERATELY WITH THE REPAIRS WITHOUT THE THREAT OF LOSING SERVICE.   NORTHERN REPLACED 29 FEET OF 4-INCH PIPE AT THE PUNCTURE SITE. THE REPLACEMENT PIPE WAS PRETESTED 4-INCH, 0.250-INCH WALL THICKNESS PIPE. NORTHERN ALSO FOUND ANOTHER SPOT ABOUT 80 FEET DOWNSTREAM WHERE THE TILING MACHINE HAD CAUSED A GREATER THAN 6% DENT WITH METAL LOSS. TWENTY FIVE FEET OF PIPE WAS INSTALLED AT THIS LOCATION.

DAN STATED THEY FIRST NOTICED THE BUBBLES ABOUT 3:30PM ON 9-13-14. THE BARELY VISIBLE SHEEN COVERED APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET WIDE BY 2600 FEET LONG WITH 50% COVERAGE. THEY REPORTED THE LEAK & SHEEN TO NRC AT 6:10PM, NRC #1095249. TRANSCO WAS INFORMED THAT HELIS HAD SHUT-IN AND BLOWN DOWN THEIR WELLS. THIS LED THEM TO BELIEVE THE BUBBLES WERE POSSIBLY COMING FROM THE TRANSCO 26"" LINE.  HELIS ALSO UTILIZED THE SERVICES OF OIL MOPS(OSRO) TO CONTAIN THE SHEEN AND THE SERVICES OF BLACKWATER DIVERS WHO HAD ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION EARLIER THAT MORNING.    WE (TRANSCO) PLOTTED COORDINATES ON OUR ALIGNMENT SHEETS, BUT IT PLOTTED OUT ABOUT 1500 FEET FROM TRANSCO 26"".  OUR TECHNICIANS, WERE SENT OUT BY HELICOPTER TO FLY OVER LEAK SITE AND LAND AT SS 45 PLATFORM(HELIS OWNED).  AT 11:35AM, OUR TECHNICIAN CALLED WITH DETAILS OF THE SHEEN WHICH WAS VERY LIGHT AND MEASURED 5 MILES LONG AND 300 FEET WIDE WITH ABOUT 30% COVERAGE. OUR TECHNICIAN RELAYED TO US UPDATED COORDINATES TAKEN BY THE HELICOPTER.  HE TOOK A FIELD BOAT TO LEAK SITE AND WAS INFORMED BY BLACKWATER DIVERS THEY SUSPECTED THAT THE BUBBLES WERE COMING FROM TRANSCO 26"" LINE.  AT 1:35PM,  TRANSCO SCHRIEVER OFFICE WAS INFORMED THAT BUBBLES WERE COMING FROM THE TRANSCO 26"" PIPELINE.  HELIS CALLED O'BRIENS AT 12 NOON ON 9-15-14 TO INFORM THEM THAT THE LEAK DID NOT BELONG TO HELIS.  SCHRIEVER OFFICE ASSUMED THE ORIGINAL NRC #1095249 THAT HELIS HAD CALLED IN WOULD ALSO APPLY TO TRANSCO LEAK ON THE 26"" PIPELINE.  AFTER CONFIRMING WITH BUD KLINE AND WITH O'BRIEN'S THAT ANOTHER NRC # WAS NECESSARY,  TOUPS CONTACTED O'BRIEN'S AT 3:13PM AND WILLIAMS (TRANSCO) GAS CONTROL AT 3:20PM.  O'BRIENS CONTACTED NRC AT 3:35PM AND RECEIVED NRC #1095398.  O'BRIEN'S ALSO CONTACTED LA. STATE POLICE AT 3:42PM AND RECEIVED #14-04128.  SCHRIEVER DISTRICT PERSONNEL ISOLATED THE 26"" PIPELINE SEGMENT 5103 AT SHIP SHOAL 70 PLATFORM AND AT DOG LAKE GENERATOR PLATFORM AT 4:22PM. NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUED BETWEEN TRANSCO & HELIS TO UTILIZE THE OSRO (OIL MOPS) AND BLACKWATER DIVERS AS WELL AS THE LIFT BOAT ON LOCATION THE DIVERS WERE USING. TRANSCO WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE OIL MOPS PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT, BUT NOT BLACKWATER DIVERS AND LIFT BOAT. SCHRIEVER THEN REQUESTED OIL MOPS PERSONNEL TO USE ABSORBENT BOOM TO ENCIRCLE THE BUBBLES, CAPTURING ANY SHEENING WITHIN THE BOOM. A DIVE VESSEL THAT WAS BEING USED BY TRANSCO ON ANOTHER JOB, WAS REQUESTED TO RELOCATE TO LEAK LOCATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. INCLEMENT WEATHER CAUSED SOME DELAYS WITH THE PIPELINE BLOWDOWN AND THE REPAIR.    SUMMARY OF LEAK INVESTIGATION & REPAIR OF THE LEAK:  DIVERS WERE SENT DOWN TO THE LEAKING PIPE, THEY PERFORMED A UT SCAN ON ALL SIDES OF THE LEAKING PIPE AND VERIFIED THAT THE THE LEAK WAS NOT EXTERNAL. THE LEAK OCCURRED ON THE LOW POINT OF THE PIPE, NEAR THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION.  A CLAMP WAS USED TO REPAIR THE LEAK AND THE LINE WAS GRADUALLY PRESSURED BACK UP TO MAOP ON 9-29-2014 AT 3:15 PM; NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.    THE HISTORY OF THIS GATHERING PIPELINE SYSTEM HAS BEEN THE TRANSPORTATION OF UNPROCESSED UNDEHYDRATED NATURAL GAS SINCE 1990.   TRANSCO FOLLOWS HAS A STRICT INTERNAL CORROSION MONITORING AND CONTROL POLICY, THIS LINE HAS BEEN TREATED SINCE 1990 WITH CORROSION INHIBITORS AND BIOCIDES.

A LIGHTNING STRIKE DAMAGED AN ELECTRIC TRANSFORMER THAT FEEDS THE HANCOCK CS AREA CAUSING LOSS OF COMMERCIAL ELECTRICAL POWER. DURING THE POWER OUTAGE, THE STATION'S EMERGENCY GENERATOR STARTED BUT POWER FAILED TO FULLY TRANSFER TO THE STATION'S RESERVE POWER IN AN AMOUNT OF TIME CAUSING STATION'S PNEUMATIC COMPRESSORS TO FAULT (AND NOT RESTART).  THE LOSS OF PNEUMATIC PRESSURE CAUSED THE STATION EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN VENT VALVES TO OPEN (A FAIL-SAFE POSITION).  HOWEVER, DUE TO THE STATION'S LOW PNEUMATIC PRESSURE SWITCH FAILING TO TRIGGER A STATION EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN, THE STATION ISOLATION (BLOCK) VALVES REMAINED IN THE OPEN POSITION CAUSING THE UNINTENDED RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.    ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO THE GENERATOR'S RESPONSE SETTINGS AND THE STATION'S LOW PNEUMATIC PRESSURE SWITCH TO PREVENT A SIMILAR FAULT FROM RE-OCCURRING.  THE DAYS FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT, SEVERAL TESTS WERE CONDUCTED TO ASSURE THE SUCCESSFUL START OF THE BACK-UP GENERATOR IN THE EVENT OF THE COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC POWER LOSS AS WELL AS THE CORRECT OPERATION OF THE LOW PNEUMATIC PRESSURE SWITCH.  DURING THE TESTING, THE BACK-UP GENERATOR STARTED SUCCESSFULLY WHENEVER THE COMMERCIAL ELECTRIC POWER WAS DISCONNECTED FROM THE MAIN BUS POWER SYSTEM AND THE LOW PRESSURE SWITCH FUNCTIONED WITH NO FAILURES BEING NOTED."

MATTHEWS.  THE STATION PROVIDES SERVICE TO A TRANSMISSION LATERAL SERVING THE DEVRO INDUSTRIAL PLANT AS WELL AS THE DOWNSTREAM PORTION OF THE ST. MATTHEWS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE.  THE STATION ITSELF RESIDES IN A PRIVATE EASEMENT WHILE THE PIPELINE THAT FEEDS IT RESIDES IN ROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY.  THE STATION FOOTPRINT IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 30' FROM THE HWY 176 TRAVEL LANE.  THE STATION HAD A GUARDRAIL IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE PIPELINE FACILITIES FROM VEHICLE DAMAGE.      ON AUGUST 28, 2014 AT APPROXIMATELY 4:33 AM (AS DETERMINED BY POST-INCIDENT REVIEW OF SCADA LOGS), A DUMP TRUCK LEFT THE ROADWAY AND STRUCK THE VALVE STATION CAUSING A MAJOR LEAK ON THE ST. MATTHEWS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE.  SCE&G'S SCADA SYSTEM REACHED ALARM CONDITIONS AT APPROXIMATELY 4:54 AM, AND SCE&G RECEIVED A CONFIRMING CALL FROM THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTING THE INCIDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 4:58 AM.  COMPANY FIRST RESPONDERS WERE NOTIFIED AND DISPATCHED AT APPROXIMATELY 5:02 AM AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 5:57 AM.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AIDED IN CLOSING THE ROAD TO TRAFFIC, EVACUATING NEARBY RESIDENTS WITHIN 500 FT OF THE INCIDENT, AND INFORMING THE SCHOOL DISTRICT OF THE INCIDENT.  ONE SCHOOL, LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES AWAY, ELECTED TO CLOSE FOR THE DAY DUE TO THE DISRUPTION OF TRAFFIC THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE ROAD CLOSURE.    WITHIN THE 500 FT RADIUS OF EVACUATION, CONDUCTED BY THE LOCAL EMERGENCY TEAMS, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 8 HOMES.   IN REFERENCE TO PART A QUESTION 18 OF THE INCIDENT REPORT, THE NUMBER OF PERSONS EVACUATED WAS PROVIDED BY THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WHO CONDUCTED THE EVACUATIONS; HOWEVER, FIRE SERVICES PERSONNEL DID NOT HAVE AN EXACT COUNT OF EVACUEES BUT CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATED THE NUMBER TO BE 100.   AT APPROXIMATELY 8:15 AM, SCE&G VALVED THE PIPELINE OUT OF SERVICE TO SHUT OFF THE ESCAPING GAS.  ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THE INCIDENT AND VALVING THE LINE OUT OF SERVICE, TWO INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS LOST SERVICE.  SCE&G WAS ABLE TO UTILIZE DOWNSTREAM LINEPACK AND A COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG) TRAILER TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO TWO SMALL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS FEEDING THE TOWNS OF ST. MATTHEWS AND CAMERON.  SCE&G COMPLETED REPAIRS TO THE MAINLINE PORTION OF THE VALVE STATION BY 7:30 PM, REESTABLISHING THE FEED TO THE TOWNS OF ST. MATTHEWS AND CAMERON.  SCE&G COMPLETED THE REMAINING REPAIRS TO THE DEVRO LATERAL TAKE-OFF PORTION OF THE STATION BY 11:30 PM, RESTORING SERVICE TO THE DEVRO PLANT.  THE REPAIRS MADE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WERE TEMPORARY WITH PLANS TO REBUILD THE STATION AT A LATER DATE.    NOTE: PART C QUESTION 3.G (YEAR OF MANUFACTURE) FOR THE PIPE INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT IS UNKNOWN. - AN ESTIMATE DATE OF 1992 WAS USED - ESTIMATED BY A MATERIAL RECORD FOR ELBOWS USED IN THE STATION."

PG&E CONDUCTED SPECIAL AERIAL PATROLS ON OVER 150 MILES OF TRANSMISSION PIPELINE. OVER 250 MILES OF TRANSMISSION PIPELINE UNDERWENT LEAK SURVEYS. PG&E IDENTIFIED FOUR LEAKS (ONE HAZARDOUS; THREE NON-HAZARDOUS) ON ITS GAS TRANSMISSION SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTIES OF NAPA, SOLANO, AND SONOMA.  THE FOUR LEAKS WERE FOUND ON VALVES (INSTALLED IN 1968, 1981, 1992, & 2004) AND WERE REPAIRED ON OR BEFORE SEPT. 5, 2014. SEVENTY-SIX REGULATOR STATIONS UNDERWENT SPECIAL LEAK SURVEYS AND NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED.  FOLLOWING THE NAPA EARTHQUAKE, SURFACE CRACKS WERE DISCOVERED IN THE GROUND AT AN APPROXIMATE 74 DEGREE ANGLE ABOVE TRANSMISSION LINE L-21A, AND AS A PRECAUTION, THE PRESSURE IN L-21A WAS LOWERED FROM 325 PSIG TO 300 PSIG. LEAK SURVEYS AND AERIAL PATROLS HAVE INDICATED NO ANOMALIES WITH THIS LINE OTHER THAN THE GROUND DISPLACEMENT OVER IT. PG&E HAS REPLACED APPROXIMATELY 210 FEET OF 26-INCH PIPE ACROSS THE FAULT CROSSING. L-21A WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2014 AT THE TEMPORARILY REDUCED PRESSURE OF 300 PSIG. PENDING FINAL APPROVAL OF ITS FITNESS FOR SERVICE EVALUATION, L-21A WILL RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE. L-21B WILL BE ISOLATED BETWEEN MLV 2.31 (NAPA RIVER CROSSING) AND MLV 6.05 AND TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE SO AN INSPECTION CAN BE PERFORMED. RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION WILL DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF L-21B PIPELINE REPLACEMENT AT THE FAULT CROSSING. L-21H PRESSURE WAS REDUCED FROM 250 PSIG TO 140 PSIG AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE. THE FITNESS FOR SERVICE EVALUATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED AND L-21H WILL TO BE RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE SHORTLY.  SAFETY-RELATED CONDITION REPORTS WERE SUBMITTED FOR L-21A AND L-21H.

DURING EXECUTION OF THE WORK, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A TAP VALVE ON 8 INCH PIPING BRANCHING OFF THE 12 INCH 202-412 LINE WAS LEAKING BY.  THE VALVE WAS REPLACED DURING THIS TIME. AS PART OF THAT EFFORT, IT WAS NOTED BY THE PROJECT MANAGEMENT TEAM THAT THE PIPE IN THIS AREA WAS LEANING/SAGGING CAUSING THE TAP VALVE TO BE POSITIONED AT AN ANGLE.  BECAUSE OF THIS, ADDITIONAL SUPPORTS WERE INSTALLED UNDER THE NEW TAP VALVE, TO HELP RELIEVE STRESS ON THE PIPE. NOTE, THE ORIGINAL TAP VALVE DID HAVE 12X12 4INCH CONCRETE SUPPORTS.      AFTER EXECUTING THE COMPLIANCE REQUIRED PIPELINE INTEGRITY WORK, THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN PUT BACK IN SERVICE ON 7/11/2014.  AT APPROXIMATELY 8:00 AM, ON 7/12/2014, A CONTRACTOR ARRIVED AT THE SITE TO COMPLETE BACKFILL AND CLEANUP OF WORK LOCATION.  WHILE BACKFILLING DIRT, THE CONTRACTOR NOTICED FUMES FROM THE GROUND IN THE AREA OF THE TAP VALVE.  ANOTHER CONTRACTOR STOPPED THE WORK ACTIVITY AND CONTACTED KINDER MORGAN OPERATIONS PERSONNEL.   AT 13:00, THE LEAK WAS CONFIRMED BY VISUAL INSPECTION TO BE IN THE AREA OF THE MAIN PIPE SLEEVE UPSTREAM OF THE TAP VALVE WHERE IT CONNECTED WITH THE 12 INCH 202-412 LINE. AT 16:35 THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTDOWN.  UPON FURTHER VISUAL EXAMINATION, THE LEAK APPEARED TO BE AT THE WELD POINT OF THE TRANSITION BRANCH OF THE 12 INCH 202-412 TO THE 8 INCH PIPING.  THE DEFECT WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO BE ANALYZED BY A METALLURGICAL LAB.       THE METALLURGICAL LAB ANALYZED THE SAMPLE AND CAME BACK WITH 4 CONCLUSIONS.  1. THE BRANCH CONNECTION FAILED DUE TO AN OVERLOAD FRACTURE, LIKELY INCDUCED BY EXTERNAL BENDING LOADS.  2. EVIDENCE OF TIME DEPENDENT CRACKING MECHANISMS, SUCH AS HIGH OR LOW CYCLE FATIGUE WAS NOT OBSERVED.  3. INSUFFICIENT STRUCTURAL SUPPORT OF THE BRANCH CONNECTION COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE WELD FAILURE.  4. THE WELD CONTAINED DEFECTS SUCH AS LACK OF FUSION; HOWEVER, THIS DOD NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE FAILURE."

THOUGH THE ESD SYSTEM TEST WAS CONSIDERED SUCCESSFUL WITH ALL VALVES AND ELECTRONICS OPERATING AS REQUIRED, THE STATION TECHNICIAN DECIDED THAT THE ACTIVATION PISTON OF THE ESD POPPET VALVE MOUNTED ON TOP OF THE VALVE ACTUATOR OF THE 8-INCH STATION SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE NEEDED ADDITIONAL  LUBRICATION.  THIS MAINTENANCE WAS PERFORMED ON JULY 11, 2014, THE DAY PREVIOUS TO THE REPORTED INCIDENT.  TO PREVENT THE 8-INCH BLOWDOWN VALVE FROM ACCIDENTALLY OPERATING DURING THIS MAINTENANCE, THE PILOT GAS AND POWER GAS SOURCES TO THE BLOWDOWN VALVE OPERATOR WERE DISABLED BY CLOSING  1/2-INCH VALVES ON THE POWER GAS AND PILOT GAS TUBING LINES AT THE VALVE OPERATOR.     AT THE COMPLETION OF THE VALVE OPERATOR MAINTENANCE, THE POWER GAS VALVE WAS REOPENED TO THE VALVE OPERATOR BUT THE PILOT GAS VALVE INADVERTENTLY REMAINED CLOSED WHEN THE BLOWDOWN VALVE AND OPERATOR WERE PUT BACK INTO SERVICE. BETWEEN COMPLETION OF THE VALVE OPERATOR MAINTENANCE ON  JULY 11 AND 3:15 AM CDT ON JULY 12, 2014, THE PRESSURIZED GAS IN THE PILOT GAS TUBING, LOCATED BETWEEN THE PILOT GAS VALVE AND THE 8-INCH STATION SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE OPERATOR, MORE THAN LIKELY LEAKED FROM A FITTING.  THIS RESULTED IN A LOSS OF PILOT GAS LINE PRESSURE AT THE OPERATOR, ALLOWED POWER GAS TO ACTIVATE THE ESD POPPET VALVE COMPONENT OF THE VALVE OPERATOR, AND RESULTED IN THE OPENING OF THE 8-INCH STATION SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE. THIS BLOWDOWN VALVE REMAINED OPEN UNTIL AN ON-DUTY STATION EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED THE OPEN VALVE AND MANUALLY CLOSED IT AT APPROXIMATELY 3:40 AM CDT.    FOLLOWING CLOSURE OF THE BLOWDOWN VALVE, TRANSCANADA PERSONNEL CALCULATED THE ESTIMATED GAS LOST DURING THE EVENT TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1.84 MMCF, WHICH WOULD HAVE PUT THE EVENT BELOW THE REPORTING THRESHOLD OF 3.0 MMCF AS STATED IN 191.3 DEFINITIONS OF AN 'INCIDENT' (THE EVENT ALSO DID NOT MEET ANY OF THE OTHER REPORTING REQUIREMENT CRITERIA IN THE DEFINITION OF AN 'INCIDENT').  HOWEVER, UPON FURTHER REVIEW OF THE EVENT THE FOLLOWING MONDAY, JULY 14, 2014, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE GAS LOSS CALCULATION HAD BEEN MISINTERPRETED, I.E., THE DECIMAL POINT WAS PLACED INCORRECTLY IN THE GAS LOSS RESULT.  UPON DETERMINING THE CORRECT GAS VOLUME LOST TO BE 18.39 MMCF, THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (NRC) AS REQUIRED."

AFTER APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES, THE SPECIALIST WAS ABLE TO STOP THE VENTING BUT DID NOT INFORM SUPERVISION OF THE ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITION. THE OPERATIONS SPECIALIST, THINKING THAT THE REPORTABLE GAS LOSS FROM THE TIME HE NOTED IT UNTIL THE TIME HE ADDRESSED IT WAS UNDER THE PHMSA LIMIT OF 3000 MCF, DID NOT REPORT THE EVENT TO SUPERVISION.  SEPARATELY, AND ALSO ON THE MORNING OF JUNE 30TH, THE MEASUREMENT TECHNICIAN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE YORK FUEL GAS METER RECEIVED A CALL FROM DATA INTEGRITY INFORMING HIM THAT THE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE TRANSMITTER FOR THE YORK FUEL GAS METER HAD OVER-RANGED OVER THE WEEKEND AND NEEDED TO BE INVESTIGATED. THE MEASUREMENT TECHNICIAN DROVE TO THE YORK C/S, ARRIVING AT 13:30 PM, BUT DID NOT FIND ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. FURTHER INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSION WITH DATA INTEGRITY, AS WELL AS A REVIEW OF SCADA DATA, DETERMINED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE HAD BEGUN VENTING ON FRIDAY, JUNE 27TH AT APPROXIMATELY 11 PM AND CONTINUED UNTIL THE OPERATIONS SPECIALIST ADDRESSED IT ON MONDAY, JUNE 30TH AT 10AM.  IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE REPORTABLE AT 17:45 PM ON JUNE 30, 2014.

THE PRODUCER WAS TO REMOVE TWO METER RUNS.  THE VALVES AT THE ENDS OF EACH METER RUN HAD BEEN CLOSED AND LOCKED AT SOME EARLIER DATE BY ANR PERSONNEL.  AT THE TIME OF PLANNED FACILITY DISCONNECTION AND REMOVAL, THE PRODUCER PERSONNEL DETERMINED THAT THE METER RUN ISOLATION VALVES WERE LEAKING AND DECIDED TO ISOLATE ADDITIONAL PIPING ON THE PLATFORM IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT NO GAS COULD MIGRATE TO THE MEASUREMENT PIPING.  TO FACILITATE THIS ADDITIONAL ISOLATION ACTIVITY, WHICH WAS NOT PART OF THE PROJECT SCOPE AND HAD NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED BY ANR MANAGEMENT, PRODUCER PERSONNEL CLOSED VALVES TO GAS SOURCES, OPENED THE PIG TRAP KICKER LINE VALVE, AND THEN OPENED THE 4' PIG TRAP VENT VALVE THROUGH WHICH THIS ISOLATED PIPING WAS EVACUATED.  AS THE PIPING AND PIG TRAP WERE BLOWING DOWN, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PRESSURE IN THE PIG TRAP AND ASSOCIATED PIPING WOULD NOT DROP TO ATMOSPHERIC.  PRODUCER PERSONNEL PRESUMED THAT ONE OF THE VALVES THEY HAD CLOSED TO ISOLATED THE PIPING FROM A GAS SOURCE MUST NOT HAVE COMPLETELY CLOSED.  IT WAS DECIDED TO ATTEMPT TO FURTHER CLOSE THE VALVE.  HOWEVER, RATHER THAN USING THE HAND PUMP TO OPERATE THE VALVE, PRODUCER PERSONNEL USED THE POWER GAS OPERATOR AND MISTAKENLY PARTLY OPENED THE VALVE.  THIS ALLOWED HIGH PRESSURE GAS (APPROXIMATELY 860 PSIG) TO ENTER THE PARTIALLY BLOWN DOWN PIPING WITH A HIGH DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE ACROSS THE OPENED VENT VALVE.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE PIG TRAP VENT ASSEMBLY, WHICH WAS MOUNTED AT THE 12 O'CLOCK POSITION ON THE TRAP BOTTLE, INCLUDED A VENT STACK THAT WAS CONFIGURED WITH A 90 DEGREE BEND INTENDED TO VENT GAS AWAY FROM THE PLATFORM.   DUE TO THE SUDDEN INCREASE IN GAS PRESSURE AND FLOW THROUGH THE VENT VALVE ASSEMBLY AND THE RESULTANT HIGH VELOCITY GAS EXITING THE 90 DEGREE VENT STACK, ENOUGH FORCE WAS PRODUCED TO CAUSE THE ENTIRE VENT ASSEMBLY TO FAIL AND DISCONNECT NEAR THE PIG TRAP BOTTLE.  FOLLOWING THE FAILURE, THE VENT VALVE ASSEMBLY HAS BEEN REBUILT AND REINSTALLED ON THE PIG TRAP.  THE SYSTEM WAS THEN PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON JUNE 28, 2014."

THE CS FACILITY IS OPERATED AND MAINTAINED BY COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION, LLC (COLUMBIA) LOCATED IN WETZEL COUNTY, WV.  COLUMBIA'S GAS CONTROL PERSONNEL NOTIFIED THE CS OPERATOR TO INVESTIGATE THIS EVENT.  UPON ARRIVAL, THE CS OPERATOR OBSERVED GAS VENTING BEHIND THE CS BUILDING.  THE GAS DETECTORS FOR UNIT #1 WERE ACTIVE INDICATING PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS. UNIT #1 DISCHARGE RELIEF VALVE (RV) WAS FOUND TO BE VENTING.  THE RV HAD VENTED FOR 77 MINUTES WITH GAS LOST ESTIMATED AT 4,664 MSCF.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION BY THE CS OPERATOR SUPPORTED BY THE MEASUREMENT AND REGULATION MECHANIC IDENTIFIED THAT THE TUBING CONNECTING THE PILOT TO THE MAIN BODY OF THE RELIEF VALVE HAD CRACKED AND FAILED.  THE TUBING WAS REPLACED AND THE UNIT WAS RETURNED TO OPERATION.  THE UNIT WAS THEN TAKEN BACK OUT OF OPERATION BECAUSE OF OBSERVED MOVEMENT OF THE RV DUE TO UNUSUALLY HIGH VIBRATION.    INVESTIGATION INTO THIS INCIDENT BY THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT, IDENTIFIED THAT EXCESSIVE VIBRATION INITIATED THE SEPARATION OF THE SENSING LINE THAT ACTIVATED THIS RV.  INSUFFICIENT PIPE SUPPORT WITH THE OPERATING CONDITIONS OF THE ENGINES, ASSISTED IN ELEVATING THE VIBRATION LEVELS WITHIN THE FACILITY.  A CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN WHERE BASED ON THE EXPERIMENTAL DATA COLLECTED BY ENGINEERING SERVICES, IT WAS DETERMINED THE RVS WILL BE REMOVED AND ELECTRONIC SHUT DOWN DEVICES WILL BE INSTALLED TO PREVENT REOCCURRENCE OF THE RELIEF VALVE TUBING FAILURES. THIS ACTION WAS IMPLEMENTED ON UNITS NO. 1 AND 2.

A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED ONCE THE LAB RESULTS ARE RECEIVED. THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS NOTIFIED AND ASSIGNED REPORT NUMBER 1085180.    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:    BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS, PLAINS HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE FAILURE WAS THE RESULT OF INTERNAL DETONATION THAT RESULTED IN SUDDEN OVER-PRESSURE OF THE PIPING AND OTHER COMPONENTS.  AIR MOVERS HAD BEEN USED TO DE-ENERGIZE A PREVIOUSLY DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPELINE PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT OF JUNE 7, 2014. AS THE PIPELINE WAS BROUGHT BACK INTO SERVICE, THE AIR WAS DISPLACED BY FLOWING PIPELINE GAS TO AND THROUGH THE VECTOR STATION TO A SILENCER EQUIPPED VENT AT THE BOOSTER STATION. THIS WAS DONE TO MINIMIZE NOISE AND DISTURBANCE TO NEARBY RESIDENCES AND LIVESTOCK. IT APPEARS THAT THE AIR HAD NOT BEEN COMPLETELY ELIMINATED FROM ALL OF THE PIPING DURING THE STATION PURGING. AS THE VECTOR STATION WAS BEING PRESSURIZED TO THE NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS (PIPELINE PRESSURE), THE HEAT OF COMPRESSION COMBINED WITH THE RESIDUAL AIR INCREASED THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GAS TO AUTO IGNITE.   THE SUBSEQUENT IGNITION OF THE FLAMMABLE GAS RESULTED IN A DETONATION/OVERPRESSURE INSIDE THE PIPE. THE PURGING PROCEDURES FOR THE PNGS PIPELINE AND THE BOOSTER STATION HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO ADDRESS THE REMOVAL OF ALL AIR/OXYGEN FROM THE PIPELINE AND THE BOOSTER STATION EQUIPMENT PRIOR TO THE EQUIPMENTS RETURN TO SERVICE, WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION FOCUSED IN ELIMINATING AIR FROM DEAD LEGS OF PIPING AND EQUIPMENT.

WARD	GAS REGULATORY SERVICES LEAD	517-545-8746	amanda.ward@cmsenergy	"AT APPROXIMATELY 9:20 AM ON APRIL 27, 2014, OILY LIQUIDS CAUSED THE PRIMARY WORKER AND MONITOR REGULATORS AT WEST WAYNE CITY GATE (29380 W. 13 MILE ROAD; FARMINGTON HILLS, MI) TO FAIL.  LIQUIDS WERE FOUND IN THE REGULATORS, PILOTS, AND PILOT FILTERS OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR RUN, AS WELL AS IN AND AROUND THE CITY GATE HEATER.  A WORN DIAPHRAGM WAS ALSO OBSERVED ON THE PRIMARY WORKER REGULATOR.    THE DOUBLE REGULATOR FAILURE RESULTED IN AN OVERPRESSURE OF THE 340 PSIG MAOP DOWNSTREAM SYSTEM.  THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT WAS ORIGINALLY IDENTIFIED VIA SCADA ALARMS BY CONSUMERS ENERGY'S GAS CONTROL AT APPROXIMATELY 9:24 AM, WHEN AN OUTLET PRESSURE OF 426 PSIG WAS MEASURED.  FIELD PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO WEST WAYNE CITY GATE AT 9:25 AM.  PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT 10:15 AM, AND THE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEM PRESSURE WAS REDUCED TO BELOW 340 PSIG AT 10:27 AM.  THE MAX PRESSURE REACHED DURING THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT WAS 455 PSIG (134% MAOP) AT APPROXIMATELY 9:48 AM.    FURTHER DOWNSTREAM OF WEST WAYNE CITY GATE, A SLUG OF LIQUIDS ALSO CAUSED A DOUBLE REGULATOR FAILURE AT A WORKER-MONITOR HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION REG STATION AT 12 MILE AND FRANKLIN ROADS, CAUSING THE MAOP OF THE MEDIUM PRESSURE SYSTEM (60 PSIG MAOP) DOWNSTREAM OF THAT FACILITY TO BE EXCEEDED AS WELL.  PRESSURES ON THIS SYSTEM REACHED 104 PSIG (173% MAOP) ACCORDING TO PRESSURE RECORDING CHARTS AT 12 MILE AND FRANKLIN. THIS RESULTED IN A VENTING RELIEF VALVE AT ANOTHER NEARBY REGULATOR STAND (LOCATED AT 29257 CHATEAU COURT, FARMINGTON HILLS AND FEEDING THE SAME 60 PSIG MAOP SYSTEM) DUE TO BACKPRESSURE.  THE BLOWING RELIEF WAS DISCOVERED AT 6:10 PM ON APRIL 27, AND VENTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 90 MINUTES.    IN SUMMARY, THREE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS WERE IMPACTED BY THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT:       - APPROXIMATELY 5.25 MILES OF 10"" STEEL PIPING (340 PSIG MAOP) OPERATING AT > 20% SMYS (AND THEREFORE CLASSIFIED AS TRANSMISSION PIPE, THOUGH OPERATED BY GAS DISTRIBUTION) RUNNING SOUTH OF WEST WAYNE CITY GATE ALONG MIDDLEBELT ROAD TO 8 MILE ROAD       - APPROXIMATELY 1.25 MILES OF 8"" STEEL HIGH PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION PIPING (340 PSIG MAOP) RUNNING EAST OF WEST WAYNE CITY GATE ALONG 13 MILE ROAD AND THEN SOUTHEAST ALONG NORTHWESTERN HIGHWAY, TO REGULATOR STATION AT 12 MILE & FRANKLIN ROADS       - APPROXIMATELY 87 MILES OF STEEL AND PLASTIC MEDIUM PRESSURE MAIN AS WELL AS 2,944 SERVICES (60 PSIG MAOP) IN FARMINGTON AND SOUTHFIELD TOWNSHIPS, DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATOR STATION AT 12 MILE & FRANKLIN ROADS    MOBILE AND WALKING LEAK SURVEY WAS PERFORMED ON THE OVERPRESSURED FACILITIES BETWEEN APRIL 28TH AND APRIL 30TH.  ADDITIONALLY, OVER 20 GALLONS OF LIQUIDS WERE COLLECTED FROM SURROUNDING DRIP SITES, WITH THE MAJORITY COLLECTED AT THE REGULATOR STATION AT 12 MILE & FRANKLIN.    FOLLOW-UP LABORATORY ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE COMPOSITION OF LIQUIDS COLLECTED AT WEST WAYNE CITY GATE AND 12 MILE & FRANKLIN WAS CONSISTENT WITH COMPRESSOR ENGINE OIL UTILIZED AT CONSUMERS ENERGY COMPRESSOR STATIONS.  AN PROGRAM OF ACCELERATED INSTALLATION OF FILTERS/SEPARATORS AT CONSUMERS ENERGY CITY GATE AND REGULATOR STATION FACILITIES IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY TO HELP PREVENT RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR DAMAGE BY DEBRIS/LIQUIDS TO REGULATORS AND OVERPRESSURE PROTECTION DEVICES."

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION IT WAS FOUND THAT THE 8-INCH SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE WAS OPEN WITH NO ALARM OR SHUTDOWN INDICATION.  THE 8""  SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE VENTED THE GAS INTO THE STATION BLOWDOWN SILENCER, WHICH LIMITS NOISE AND RESTRICTS FLOW VOLUME.  IN ADDITION, THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES REMAINED OPEN, AS THE STATION HAD NOT SHUT IN. THE STATION TECHNICIAN IMMEDIATELY SHUT IN THE STATION, WHICH WAS NOT OPERATING AT THE TIME, AND ISOLATED IT FROM THE PIPELINE BY CLOSING THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES.  GAS CONTROL WAS THEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE STATION SUCTION BLOWDOWN VALVE PNEUMATIC PILOT PRESSURE SWITCH HAD ACTIVATED BECAUSE WATER HAD ACCUMULATED AND FROZE IN THE SWITCH AND PILOT GAS SENSING LINES RESULTING IN A LOSS OF PRESSURE TO THE SWITCH.  THE LOSS OF PILOT GAS CAUSED THE PILOT PRESSURE SWITCH TO CHANGE STATE AND TO PNEUMATICALLY COMMAND THE BLOWDOWN VALVE TO ITS FAILSAFE POSITION, WHICH IS OPEN. LIQUIDS AND ICE WERE REMOVED FROM THE AFFECTED TUBING AND SWITCH, AS WELL AS FROM SIMILAR COMPONENTS ELSEWHERE AT THE STATION, THE AFFECTED BLOWDOWN VALVE WAS TESTED, AND STATION WAS PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE THE FOLLOWING WEEK.  RECOMMENDATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO MODIFY THE TUBING TO THE AFFECTED SWITCHES TO ELIMINATE THE ACCUMULATION OF LIQUIDS.  IN ADDITION, IT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO MODIFY STATION CONTROL LOGIC TO SHUT DOWN THE STATION AND CLOSE THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES WHEN ANY BLOWDOWN VALVE INDICATES OPEN AND TO ANNUNCIATE AN ALARM TO GAS CONTROL."

THE RELIEF VALVE IS LOCATED ON MAINLINE BLOCK VALVE IDENTIFIED AS BBB01 BETWEEN TWO MAINLINES; M880B AND M883B. THE PIPELINES ARE ALSO PROTECTED BY A CONTROL VALVE WITH PRESSURE OVERRIDE AND SLAM VALVES THAT THE ATLAS PIPELINE MIDKIFF AND WEST TEXAS GAS (WTG) SONORA / BENEDUM RECEIPT POINTS. THIS IS A VERY REMOTE AND UNATTENDED LOCATION. ON APRIL 11, 2014 AT 05:30 THE RELIEF VALVE VENTING WAS IDENTIFIED BY AN ATLAS EMPLOYEE WHILE PERFORMING ROUTINE MAINTENANCE ON THEIR EQUIPMENT NEARBY. THE VENTING WAS SO SMALL THAT SCADA DID NOT DETECT ANY NOTICABLE DROP IN PRESSURES. THE NATURAL GAS VENTING OVER A 3 DAY PERIOD MADE THIS EVENT A REPORTABLE INCIDENT.    THE PIPELINE HAS A 550 MAOP AND THE RELIEF VENTED AT 545 AND NEVER COMPLETELY RESET. THE CAUSE OF THE RELIEF VALVE VENTING HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED.    **UPDATE** THE DOWNSTREAM COMPRESSOR STATION (SPRABERRY) HAD CONDUCTED ITS' ANNUAL ESD TESTING AND WAS NOT COMPRESSING. DELIVERIES WERE STILL BEING MADE TO THE PIPELINE SYSTEM AND THE PRESSURE BEGAN TO RISE. FORTUNATELY, THE 30-INCH PIPELINE IS NEARLY 100 MILES LONG SO PRESSURES INCREASED SLOWLY. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE RELIEF WAS SET BELOW THE PIPELINE MAOP AND BEGAN TO WEEP. FURTHERMORE, THE RELIEF VALVE IS AN OLD STYLE AND DID NOT RESET IMMEDIATELY, THEREBY CAUSING GAS TO EXPEL TO ATMOSPHERE FOR SOME TIME.    ***ADDITIONAL INFO*** AFTER DISCOVERY, THE RELIEF VALVE WAS TESTED AND RESET. IT IS STILL SET BELOW THE ACTUAL MAOP OF THE PIPELINE. THE MAOP IS ""GRANDFATHERED"". THE PIPELINE IS UNDER A SELF-IMPOSED PRESSURE RESTRICTION CONSIDERING OPERATING HISTORY AND KNOWN CORROSION. THE RELIEF WAS LAST INSPECTED AND TESTED BY MORRIS FIELD SERVICES, LLC ON MARCH 25, 2014. NORTHERN PERSONNEL WILL VERIFY SCHEDULED COMPRESSOR STATION OUTAGES AND CUSTOMER SHUT-INS DO NOT ADVERSELY AFFECT PIPELINE FLOWS.    ***UPDATE***THE PIPELINE WAS NOT OPERATING UNDER A SELF-IMPOSED PRESSURE RESTRICTION. THE MAOP HAS BEEN 550 SINCE 2004. UPDATED PART E.    ***MORE INFO***THE PRESSURE OVERRIDE SET POINTS FOR FLOW AND PRESSURE CONTROL VALVES WERE RESET TO SLIGHTLY UNDER MAOP.

GAS CONTROL DID RECEIVE A CALL AT 0630 HOURS FROM THE PUBLIC REPORTING BLOWING GAS IN A RURAL AREA APPROXIMATELY 6 MILES SOUTH OF PENWELL, TX AND 1/2 MILE EAST OF ROAD FM 1601 IN ECTOR COUNTY. OWT PERSONNEL WERE DIRECTED TO THIS SITE AND WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF BLOWING GAS AS OWT LINE 4000-000, COMMONLY KNOWN AS THE JV OR JOINT VENTURE LINE. BLOCK VALVES UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE SITE WERE MANUALLY CLOSED BY 0725 HOURS AND THE ISOLATED SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS ALLOWED TO BLOW DOWN TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE. THE SITE IS RURAL AND THERE WERE NO BUILDINGS INTENDED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY WITHIN 1/2 MILE OF THE SITE.  LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE ON SITE WHEN OWT PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT 0645 HOURS. THERE WAS NO FIRE OR EXPLOSION DUE TO THE RELEASE. THE PIPE THAT FAILED WAS SECURED AND SENT TO A LAB IN TULSA, OK TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE.         UPDATE: THE FAILURE ANALYSIS PERFORMED BY ELEMENT LABS IN TULSA, OK CONCLUDED THAT THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE WAS AN INITIAL DUCTILE FAILURE OF A FIELD MADE GIRTH WELD WHICH INITIATED THE FAILURE OF THE ADJOINING PIPE JOINT LONG SEAM.  THE THIRD PARTY FAILURE ANALYSIS INDICATED THE CAUSE OF THE GIRTH WELD FAILURE WAS AN APPROXIMATELY ONE QUARTER INCH DIAMETER VOID LOCATED AT THE LOCATION OF AN ADJOINING LONGITUDINAL PIPE JOINT SEAM.  THIS GIRTH WELD ALSO HAD AREAS OF INCOMPLETE FUSION AND FAILED DUE TO DUCTILE OVERLOAD IN THE VICINITY OF THE VOID.  SIGNS OF FATIGUE WERE ALSO OBSERVED ON THE GIRTH WELD FAILURE SURFACES ALONG AREAS OF INCOMPLETE FUSION.  WHEN THE GIRTH WELD FAILED, THE CRACK PROPAGATED INTO THE LONGITUDINAL SEAM AND THEN BY RAPID BRITTLE FRACTURE, IT PROCEEDED DOWN THE LENGTH OF THE LONGITUDINAL PIPE SEAM CAUSING THE PIPELINE RUPTURE."

FURTHER INVESTIGATON BY OPERATOR PERSONNEL DETECTED NATURAL GAS ALONG CURB LINES AND IN MANHOLES. NORTHERN NATURAL GAS WORKED WITH LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANIES TO RE-ROUTE GAS AROUND THE 12-INCH PIPELINE WHILE REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED. NINE HOMES AND ABOUT 18 PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD WERE EVACUATED AND 5 OF THOSE HOMES HAD THE ELECTRICITY SHUT OFF. THE HOMEOWNERS WERE AWAY FROM THEIR HOMES OVERNIGHT WHILE PIPELINE CREWS RE-ROUTED GAS. THE PIPELINE WAS REPAIRED WITH A CYLINDER OF PIPE AND RETURNED TO SERVICE WITHOUT INCIDENT ON MARCH 23, 2014.     THE PIPELINE HAD AN 8-INCH LONG CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK NEAR A GIRTH WELD. THE CRACK RESEMBLED A TEAR IN THE PIPE BODY. THE SECTION WAS SENT TO A LAB FOR ANALYSIS. THE PIPE JUMPED WHEN CUT TO BEGIN REPAIRS SO WE BELIEVE THE PIPE WAS IN A BIND. THAT IS, THE PIPE WAS BEING FORCED TO CHANGE DIRECTION (SLIGHTLY) WITHOUT A FITTING OR BEND.    UPDATE: LABORATORY ANALYSIS: THE CRACK APPEARS TO BE CAUSED BY BENDING FORCES ON THE PIPELINE. THE LAB REPORT INDICATED THAT THE FAILURE OCCURRED AT DORMANT CIRCUMFERENTIAL SCC CRACKS. IN THIS CASE, IT WAS NOT THE GROWTH OF CIRCUMFERENTIAL SCC THAT RESULTED IN FAILURE. IT WAS HIGH BENDING/TENSILE STRESSES THAT CAUSED OVERLAOD WHERE THE CRACKS WERE PRESENT. THE LAB SITED LOWER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES (LOWER PIPE TOUGHNESS DUE TO LOWER TEMPS AND HIGH TENSILE STRESS DUE TO PIPE CONTRACTION) CONTRIBUTING TO THE FAILURE. SCC WAS NOT THE ROOT CAUSE OF FAILURE. IT WAS HIGH BENDING/TENSILE STRESS COUPLED WITH LOWER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES."

CONSUMERS ENERGY'S GAS CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED AT 9:47 AM OF THE LEAK.  CONSUMERS ENERGY CREWS ARRIVED ON SITE AND DISCOVERED A NATURAL GAS LEAK ON LATERAL #6, APPROXIMATELY 90 YARDS FROM WELL O-119.  LATERAL #6 WAS ISOLATED BY CLOSING ALL VALVES AFFECTING GAS FLOW TO THE LATERAL.  THE LATERAL WAS SUBSEQUENTLY BLOWN DOWN AND TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE.  THE CONTROLLED BLOWDOWN WAS COMPLETED AT 3:20 PM ON MARCH 15.    PRELIMINARY INCIDENT INVESTIGATION REVEALED A 7/32"" DIAMETER HOLE IN THE GIRTH WELD OF THE 10"" STEEL PIPE, APPARENTLY DUE TO INTERNAL CORROSION PITTING.  THE LATERAL CURRENTLY REMAINS OUT OF SERVICE UNTIL INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED.    A TELEPHONIC REPORT WAS INITIALLY FILED WITH NRC DUE TO A POTENTIAL FOR GAS LOSSES IN EXCESS OF 3 MMCF (MILLION CUBIC FEET).  EXPOSURE OF THE   LEAK AND SUBSEQUENT CALCULATIONS DETERMINED THAT THE VOLUME OF GAS RELEASED WAS MUCH SMALLER; HOWEVER AN INCIDENT REPORT IS STILL BEING FILED DUE TO INCURRED COSTS IN EXCESS OF $50,000.    NO FIRE DEPARTMENT, POLICE, BLOCKED TRAFFIC OR MEDIA PRESENCE WAS NOTED ON SITE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.    THE DAMAGE SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS TRANSPORTED TO THE CONSUMERS ENERGY TRAIL STREET LABORATORY FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION. THE LABORATORY EVALUATION AND THE HISTORICAL EVIDENCE CONFIRMED THE LEAK WAS DUE TO EFFECTS OF INTERNAL CORROSION.    IN ADDITION TO COMPREHENSIVE METALLURGICAL TESTING, CONSUMERS ENERGY CONTRACTED IN-LINE INSPECTION VENDOR, INLINE DEVICES  TO INSPECT THE LATERAL AND SYSTEM INTEGRITY EMPLOYEES CONDUCTED A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE FINDINGS; IDENTIFYING MULTIPLE DIG LOCATIONS TO VALIDATE TOOL DATA AND DEVELOP A REMEDIATION PLAN.

FINAL LEAK (METALLLURGICAL) EVALUATION  -   THE TOE CRACK OBSERVED IN THE MAIN LINE PIPE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A HYDROGEN INDUCED CRACK, OR COLD CRACK.THE HYDROGEN WOULD HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED DURING THE WELDING PROCESS, ALTHOUGH LOW-HYDROGEN ELECTRODES CAN HELP REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR HYDROGEN ENTRAPMENT. HARDENED MICROSTRUCTURES IN THE HEAT-AFFECTED ZONE OF A WELD CAN BE PRODUCED BY EXCESSIVE COOLING RATES AND THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE PRE- AND POST-HEAT WELD PROCEDURES. THE AMOUNT OF PRE- AND POST-HEAT DEPENDS ON MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE WALL THICKNESS AND THE CARBON EQUIVALENT OF THE PIPE. RESIDUAL STRESSES CAUSED BY RESTRAINT INDUCED DURING WELDING ARE ALSO A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO HYDROGEN CRACKING."

UIS COORDINATED THE REMOVAL OF THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPING FROM THE GAS FIRED HEATER ON 4/1/14.  AN INTACT EXEMPLAR PIPE SECTION FROM A LOWER ELEVATION WITHIN THE GAS FIRED HEATER WAS ALSO REMOVED AT THE SAME TIME TO BE ANALYZED WITH THE FAILED SECTION.  THE SAMPLES WERE SENT TO FORENSIC CONSULTANTS GROUP, LLC (FCG) IN DENVER, CO TO EVALUATE THE FAILED PIPE SECTION AND TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT MATERIAL SELECTION, PRE-EXISTING DAMAGE, USER ERROR, OPERATING CONDITIONS, AND/OR DESIGN/MANUFACTURING DEFECTS CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO THE OBSERVED FAILURE.    FCG FINDING:  - THE ""FISHMOUTH"" TYPE RUPTURE IN THE SPOOL PIECE SHOWED EXTENSIVE DEFORMATION AND THINNING TYPICAL OF A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM OVERHEAT FAILURE.  - EXTENSIVE SECONDARY CRACKING WAS NOTED IN BOTH THE CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE SPOOL PIECE AND IN THE SPOOL PIECE MATERIAL ITSELF.  THE PRESENCE OF THE EXTENSIVE SECONDARY CRACKING ALONG WITH THE CRACKING THAT LED TO THE FAILURE SHOWS THAT THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO A UNIFORM CONDITION IN THE PIPING SUCH AS EXCESSIVE TEMPERATURE, PRESSURE, OR INADEQUATE WALL THICKNESS RATHER THAN AN ISOLATED DEFECT.  - THE ULTIMATE FAILURE OF THE SPOOL PIECE WAS CAUSED BY ELEVATED-TEMPERATURE THINNING OF THE TUBE WALL AND THE INITIATION AND GROWTH OF CREEP CRACKS TO THE POINT WHERE THE REMAINING CROSS SECTION COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE INTERNAL GAS PRESSURE.  - THE RESULTS OF THE OPTICAL EMISSION SPECTROSCOPY (OES) OF THE MATERIAL SHOWED THAT THE CHEMICAL COMPOSITION WAS WITHIN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SA106 GRADE B MATERIAL.  - THE RESULTS OF THE TENSILE TESTS INDICATE THAT THE SPOOL PIECE AND THE ADJACENT PIPING MATERIAL MET THE MECHANICAL PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS OF SA106 GRADE B MATERIAL.  WBI HAS ANALYZED THE FINDINGS IN THE FCG REPORT AND HAVE INITIATED TAKING SEVERAL STEPS TO PREVENT THIS INCIDENT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN ON THE REPLACEMENT UNIT AND ON EXISTING UNITS.   DURING THE INSTALLATION OF THE NEW GAS FIRED HEATER, WBI WILL REQUIRE THE MANUFACTURE OF THE GAS FIRED HEATER TO BE ONSITE FOR THE STARTUP/COMMISSIONING AND VERIFICATION OF ALL LOGIC, SYSTEM INTERLOCKS, AND SHUTDOWNS.  ADDITIONAL SHUTDOWNS WILL BE ADDED TO THE LOGIC INCLUDING A SHUTDOWN REQUIRING THE REGEN COMPRESSOR TO BE IN A RUN STATE FOR THE GAS FIRED HEATER TO BE IN OPERATION AND A SECONDARY DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SHUTDOWN DEVICE WILL BE ADDED TO MEASURE FLOW GOING INTO THE GAS FIRED HEATER AND SHUTDOWN ON LOW FLOW CONDITIONS.     IN ADDITION TO THE STEPS WBI WILL TAKE ON THE REPLACEMENT GAS FIRED HEATER UNIT, WBI WILL ALSO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS WITH OUR EXISTING UNITS TO CONFIRM THEY ARE IN SATISFACTORY OPERATIONAL CONDITION.    PRIOR TO THE END OF 2014 WBI WILL:    - DEVELOP A PLAN TO VERIFY THE INTEGRITY OF THE TUBING BUNDLES TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF TUBE SWELLING AND CRACKING AND FULLY IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN WITHIN 12 MONTHS,   - ESTABLISH CRITERIA AND VERIFY THAT SYSTEM SHUTDOWNS OCCUR QUICKLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANY DAMAGE FROM OCCURRING IN THE CASE OF A UNIT MALFUNCTION, AND  - INSPECT AND CALIBRATE ALL GAS FIRED HEATER EQUIPMENT.    WBI WILL STANDARDIZE THE INSPECTION AND CALIBRATION FORM AND REQUIRE THAT ALL STATIONS INSPECT AND CALIBRATE ALL GAS FIRED HEATER EQUIPMENT ANNUALLY; AND WBI WILL IMPLEMENT THE DEVELOPED INSPECTION PLAN OF THE TUBING BUNDLES TO BE DONE EVERY THREE YEARS.  WBI FEELS IMPLEMENTING THE ABOVE DESCRIBED PROCESSES IS A PRUDENT APPROACH TO MITIGATING SAFETY CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT."

AT 02:00, THE BRM OPERATOR DIRECTED A TRANSMISSION TECH TO REPORT TO COLUMBUS COMPRESSOR STATION(CCS)TO INVESTIGATE AND CORRECT THE CAUSE OF THE SHUTDOWN, AND THE HIGH DIFFERENTIAL FOR THE PARTICULATE FILTERS. TECH ARRIVED AT THE CCS AT 02:45. TECH DETERMINED THE PARTICULATE FILTERS ON THE GLYCOL SKID AT THE DEHYDRATION PLANT WERE PLUGGED (CAUSE NOT CLEAR AT THE TIME BUT ASSUMED TO BE BY SALT) CAUSING THE INCREASE IN PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL. TECH NOTICED THAT THE LOCAL CONTROL PANEL INDICATED THE CAUSE OF PLANT SHUTDOWN TO BE HIGH LIQUID LEVEL IN THE FLASH TANK. TECH DRAINED THE CAGE FOR THE FLASH TANK LEVEL SWITCH TO RESET THE SWITCH AND THIS CAUSED THE PUMPS TO RESTART AUTOMATICALLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CONTROL LOGIC FOR THE PLANT. TECH PROCEEDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH NORMAL PROCEDURE TO BYPASS AND DRAIN THE FILTER CASING TO REMOVE AND REPLACE THE FILTER ELEMENTS. WHILE CHANGING THE FILTERS, TECH HEARD THE LIQUID LEVEL CONTROL VALVE ON CONTACTOR A GO WIDE OPEN. TECH OBSERVED A HIGH LEVEL OF GLYCOL IN THE CONTACTOR SIGHT GLASS. TO SHUT OFF THE FLOW OF GLYCOL TO CONTACTOR A, THE TECH OPENED THE PUMP BYPASS VALVE. THE PUMPS STARTED CAVITATING, SO THE TECH OPENED ALL PUMP BYPASS VALVES WHICH IS STANDARD PROCEDURE WHEN PUMP CAVITATION OCCURS.  THE TECH OBSERVED THE LEVEL OF GLYCOL IN THE REBOILER WAS HIGH. AT THIS SAME INSTANT, THE TECH OBSERVED THE EMISSION CONTROL SYSTEM (ECS) FLARE STACK IGNITE WITH A LARGE FLAME. TECH ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE REBOILER DRAIN VALVE TO DRAIN GLYCOL FROM THE REBOILER TO THE SURGE TANK AND STABILIZE LEVELS IN THE SYSTEM.TECH THEN HEARD THE CREAKING NOISE OF WHAT APPEARED TO BE EXPANDING PIPE AND IMMEDIATELY EVACUATED THE BUILDING. TECH CONTACTED THE BRM OPERATORS TO INFORM THEM OF THE FIRE AND TO DISCONTINUE FLOW THROUGH THE CCS. AFTER THE TECH LEFT THE BUILDING THE SIGHT GLASS ON THE REBOILER BROKE SPILLING 1200 GALLONS OF GLYCOL IN THE BUILDING. TECH DID NOT ACTIVATE THE MANUAL PULL STATION FOR THE SAFETY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM (SSD) FOR THE DEHYDRATION PLANT SINCE THE GAS RELIEF STACKS WERE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FIRE IN THE ECS FLARE STACK. INSTEAD,THE TECH MANUALLY OPENED THE CONTACTOR BLOW-DOWN VALVES TO EVACUATE GAS FROM THE PLANT BUILDING AND DIRECT THE GAS TO THE BLOW-DOWN SILENCER AT A SAFE DISTANCE FROM THE FIRE. THE BLOW-DOWN OF CONTACTOR A AND THE COMPRESSOR FUEL GAS SYSTEM WAS FOLLOWED BY THE BLOW-DOWN OF CONTACTOR B AT APPROXIMATELY 04:00. ADDITIONAL TECHNICIANS ARRIVED AT THE CCS AT APPROXIMATELY 04:00 AND 04:30. SUPERVISOR ARRIVED AT 05:30. TEAM ATTEMPTED TO USE THE 150# FIRE EXTINGUISHER TO QUENCH THE FIRE ON TOP OF THE FLARE STACK WITHOUT SUCCESS. THE FIRE IN THE ECS FLARE STAKE CONTINUED TO BURN, AND THE TECHS OBSERVED RED LIGHT FOR LEL ALARM AND REALIZED THE CONCENTRATION OF GAS WAS BUILDING UP INSIDE THE DEHYDRATION BUILDING. THE TECHS AND THE SUPERVISOR WERE UNABLE TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKING GAS INSIDE THE BUILDING SINCE THE BUILDING WAS FILLED WITH STEAM FROM THE SPILLED GLYCOL. ONCE THE GLYCOL COOLED, THE TECHS ENTERED THE BUILDING AND OBSERVED GAS WAS LEAKING AT THE BROKEN SIGHT GLASS ON THE REBOILER.  INITIALLY THE TECHS AND SUPERVISOR BELIEVED THAT THE SOURCE OF FUEL TO THE ECS WAS GLYCOL AND HYDROCARBON AND NOT NATURAL GAS. THE TEAM FOUND OUT IT WAS NATURAL GAS THAT WAS FEEDING THE FIRE WHEN THEY TURNED OFF THE VALVES TO THE SIGHT GLASS ON THE REBOILER AND THE FLAME OUTSIDE ON THE OUTSIDE ON THE ECS FLARE INCREASED.

CAUSE OF RUPTURE   PSNC ENERGY DETERMINED FROM THE INVESTIGATION OF THE REMOVED SECTION OF T-33 AND OBSERVATIONS MADE DURING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE / RESTORATION EFFORTS THAT THE RUPTURE WAS CAUSED BY MECHANICAL DAMAGES THAT OCCURRED DURING THE 2003 INSTALLATION OF THE 4-INCH PLASTIC DISTRIBUTION.  THE DISTRIBUTION PIPE WAS INSTALLED BY PSNC ENERGY'S CONTRACTOR USING A HORIZONTAL DIRECTIONAL BORE METHOD.  AT THE TIME OF THE 2003 CONSTRUCTION, SAND HILL ROAD HAD NOT BEEN WIDENED TO THE POINT WHERE IT EXTENDED OVER T-33.  THE LOCATION OF T-33 WAS NOT PROPERLY IDENTIFIED AND THE BORE PATH FOR THE DISTRIBUTION LINE WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS T-33.  WHILE FOLLOWING THE T-33 DITCH LINE THE BORING HEAD CREATED SHALLOW SCRATCHES ALONG T-33.  THE DIRECTIONAL BORING HEAD HIT THE 18-INCH CULVERT AND CREATED DEEP GOUGES AS THE HEAD WAS ROTATED TO CLEAR THE OBSTRUCTION.  THE DEEP GOUGES CREATED SHEAR CRACKS WHICH SET UP CONDITIONS THAT ULTIMATELY LED TO THE RUPTURE OF THE PIPELINE.  THIS WAS CONFIRMED BY METALLURGICAL TECHNOLOGIES, INC. P.A. REPORT 2014141 (3/20/2014).  THIS REPORT DISCOUNTED ANY ADDITIONAL STRESSES CREATED BY THE CULVERT.      REMEDIAL ACTIONS  PRESSURE ON T-33 WAS LIMITED TO 175 PSIG FROM THE TIME OF THE TEMPORARY REPAIR UNTIL PERMANENT REPAIRS COULD BE MADE.  PSNC ENERGY FILED A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT IN ACCORDANCE WITH 49 CFR PART 191.25 ON JANUARY 15, 2014.      PSNC ENERGY MADE THE DECISION TO REPLACE THE 1,000 FOOT SECTION OF T-33 THAT RAN PARALLEL TO THE 4-INCH DISTRIBUTION LINE.  ONSITE CONSTRUCTION BEGAN ON JANUARY 16, 2014 AND THE NEW SEGMENT WAS IN SERVICE ON FEBRUARY 1, 2014 WHICH CORRECTED THE PIPELINE ISSUES WHICH CREATED THE SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT. SYSTEM PRESSURE HAS BEEN RESTORED TO 350 PSIG AND THE SCADA ALARMS HAVE BEEN RESET.  AN UPDATE OF THE STATUS OF THE SAFETY RELATED CONDITION REPORT WAS PROVIDED TO CHRIS TAYLOR, PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION - SOUTHERN REGION, BY EMAIL FROM SCOTT SWINDLER ON MARCH 3, 2014.      DAMAGE ESTIMATES  THE FIRE AND RUPTURE CAUSED DAMAGE TO SEVERAL CARS, HOMES AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN THE AREA.  IN ADDITION, THE ROAD, AND SEVERAL OTHER UTILITIES WERE DAMAGED.  ALL DAMAGE ESTIMATES WITHIN THE INCIDENT REPORT HAVE BEEN UPDATED WITH ACTUAL VALUES AS OF FEBRUARY 13, 2015."

A NUISANCE LEAK WAS IDENTIFIED AT THE WEST STOPPLE WELDED TEE BY A CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE. COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION (COLUMBIA) WHO OPERATES AND MAINTAINS MPC'S PIPELINE, INVESTIGATED THE LEAK. PLANS BY ENGINEERING AND FIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE SET IN MOTION TO RECTIFY THE NUISANCE LEAK. A DECISION BY COLUMBIA ENGINEERING SERVICES AND FIELD OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WAS MADE TO REDUCE THE OPERATING PRESSURE TO A SAFE VALUE TO 20% OF ITS CURRENT OPERATING PRESSURE AND PERFORM FOLLOW-UP NON-DESTRUCTIVE TESTING (NDT) TO THE IDENTIFIED LOCATION OF THE LEAK.   LINE OPERATING PRESSURE WAS 950 PSIG WHEN THE LEAK WAS DETECTED.  A NDT WAS NOT PERFORMED UNTIL A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CONTRACTOR'S EMPLOYEES WAS ESTABLISHED.  AN ADDITIONAL PRESSURE REDUCTION WAS MADE AND THE AREA AROUND THE LEAK WAS RE-EVALUATED.  THEREAFTER, A DECISION WAS MADE TO ISOLATE THE LINE IN ORDER TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED LEAK LOCATION.  THE LINE WAS PURGED AND ISOLATED.  COURTESY NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND THE NEAR-BY RESIDENCE ABOUT THE ONGOING ACTIVITY AND THE NOISE ASSOCIATED WITH THE REQUIRED BLOWDOWN.   THE NEIGHBOR DECLINED THE OFFER TO MOVE TO A LODGING ACCOMMODATION AND ELECTED TO VISIT A NEAR-BY RELATIVE.  AFTER MIDNIGHT, THE LINE WAS ISOLATED.    ON JANUARY 6, 2013, THE AREA OF INTEREST WAS TESTED BY THE NDT TEAM AFTER SECURING THE AREA TO BE SAFE TO OPERATE.   PRELIMINARY NDT FINDINGS INDICATED THREE TRANSVERSE CRACKS; CIRCUMFERENTIALLY AT THE 09:00, 11:30 AND 12:00 O'CLOCK POSITIONS.  THOSE FINDINGS INDICATED THE NEED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE CRACKS FOR DEPTH AND WELD CONDITION OF THE WEST STOPPLE FITTING. THE NEED TO NDT THE SURFACE OF THE REMAINING WELDS OF THE WEST FITTING AS WELL AS THE EAST FITTING WAS DISCUSSED AND ACTED UPON.  A CRACK IN A CIRCUMFERENTIAL WELD ON THE EAST STOPPLE FITTING WAS DISCOVERED AT THE 3 O'CLOCK POSITION.  THE INSTALLED STOPPLE FITTINGS WITH THE ASSOCIATED WELDS WERE CUT OUT AND REMOVED. A REPLACEMENT OF THE CUT OUT SECTION OF THE PIPE WAS COMPLETED WITH A PRE-TESTED 30-IN PIPING.  THIS REPAIR METHOD WAS DETERMINED TO BE THE APPROPRIATE PERMANENT REPAIR.  A FOLLOW-UP REVIEW WITH THE HELP OF AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT WAS UNDERTAKEN.      ON DECEMBER 7, 2013, NDT WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEW WELDS AND THE ISOLATED SECTION WAS PURGED WITH A LEAK SURVEY PERFORMED IN AND AROUND THE EXCAVATED AREA.  THE LINE WAS LOADED INCREMENTALLY AND RESURVEYED FOR ANY LEVELS OF LEL."

OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED AT APPROXIMATELY 0640 HOURS AND VERIFIED THE LEAK TO BE ON ONEOK FACILITIES AT 0725 HOURS.  THE HYDRO FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED AND PROVIDED TRAFFIC CONTROL UNTIL THE LEAK COULD BE ISOLATED AT 0840 HOURS.  THE LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE RESULTED FROM A FAILED 2 INCH VALVE ON THE PIPELINE DRIP.  THE FAILED VALVE WAS REPLACED WITH A PLUG AND THE PIPELINE RETURNED TO SERVICE AT 1530 HOURS ON JULY 28, 2013.  NO CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED.  A FAILURE ANALYSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED ON THE FAILED 2 INCH VALVE.  POST INCIDENT REVIEW OF SCADA DATA INDICATED THAT A SMALL PRESSURE DROP RECORDED AT 0142 HOURS ON JULY 28 WAS PROBABLY WHEN THE DRIP VALVE FAILED.  THAT PRESSURE DROP WAS NOT OF SUFFICIENT MAGNITUDE TO BE JUDGED ABNORMAL WHEN IT OCCURRED.  IT IS ESTIMATED THE UNINTENTIONAL GAS LOSS EXCEEDED 3 MILLION CUBIC FEET 83 MINUTES LATER THEREFORE MAKING THE LEAK REPORTABLE AT  0305 HOURS.  THIS TIME IS USED IN PART A OF THIS INCIDENT REPORT AS THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  THE OKLAHOMA CORPORATION COMMISSION WAS CONTACTED AT 0832 HOURS AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS CONTACTED AT 0842 HOURS - REFERENCE PHMSA INCIDENT NUMBER 1055311.

AFTER CONFIRMING THE RUPTURE, ENOGEX CLOSED THE UPSTREAM VALVE AT ROBBERS CAVE JUNCTION, AND PROCEEDED TO THE KINTA YARD TO CLOSE THE DOWNSTREAM VALVE ON L-111, AND AT THIS POINT WAS ABLE TO CONFIRM THE RUPTURE. AFTER THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN, ENOGEX EVALUATED THE PIPELINE AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE WAS ON AN INACTIVE 4"" LATERAL (ARCO SNOW LATERAL) THAT TIES INTO L-111.  AT THE TIME OF THE RUPTURE THE LATERAL WAS CAPPED AND INACTIVE. SINCE THE RUPTURE OCCURRED IN AN AREA BETWEEN L-111 AND THE BLIND INSTALLED ON THE ARCO LATERAL, L-111 TRANSMISSION GAS WAS VENTING THROUGH THE RUPTURE ON THE LATERAL.    THE DECISION WAS MADE TO REMOVE 44' OF L-111 PIPE, INCLUDING THE ARCO TIE IN, AND REPLACING IT WITH 44' OF NEW PIPE.   LINE 111 WAS REPAIRED AND PLACED BACK INTO SERVICE ON 7/2/13."

THE VALVE FLANGE RING JOINT GROOVES WERE  CLEANED AND THE VALVE REASSEMBLED. IN SUMMARY, THE TRANSCO RCA CONCLUDED THAT THE 16"" CHECK VALVE LEAK WAS THE  RESULT OF IMPROPER INSTALLATION OF THE 16"" CHECK VALVE COVER FLANGE, MORE THAN LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VALVE CLAPPER  REMOVAL DURING A 1980 REPAIR. THE 16"" LINE WAS REPESSURED AND THE CHECK VALVE SHOWED NO SIGNS OF LEAKING. THE LINE IS  NOW IN FULL OPERATION."

THE BATTERY CHARGER THAT WAS SPIKING HIGH TOOK OVER THE LOAD AND THEN FAULTED LOW RESULTING IN A LOW 24VDC SUPPLY TO THE CONTROL PANEL.     THE LOW VOLTAGE AT THE CONTROL PANEL RESULTED IN VARIOUS DIGITAL INPUT AND OUTPUT CARDS TO FAIL WHICH RESULTED IN THE ESD EVENT.  ALTHOUGH THE STATION SUCTION AND DISCHARGE VALVES INDICATED CLOSED, THE DISCHARGE VALVE DID NOT FULLY CLOSE AND HAD TO BE MANUALLY ACTUATED TO FULLY CLOSE.  THE CLOSED STATUS, WHICH DROPS THE OUTPUT TO THE VALVE, WAS AN INACCURATE INDICATION CREATED DUE TO THE LOW VOLTAGE SUPPLYING THAT DIGITAL INPUT CARD.

THE PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT 845 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, WITH AN ESTABLISHED MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE (MAOP) OF 1052 PSIG.   THERE WAS NO FIRE, EXPLOSION, INJURY/DEATH, OR MAJOR PRIVATE PROPERTY DAMAGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUPTURE.      THE RUPTURE WAS IDENTIFIED BY TALLGRASS GAS CONTROL OPERATORS AT 02:31 WHEN A DOWNSTREAM COMPRESSOR STATION ALARMED ON A LOW COMPRESSION RATE.    PRESSURE TRENDING INDICATED ABNORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS (AOC) ON THE 135 MILE-LONG PXP GUERNSEY-STERLING SEGMENT.   LOCAL FIELD OPERATORS WERE CONTACTED AND BEGAN SHUTTING IN THE SEGMENT VIA ISOLATION VALVES AT INTERCONNECT POINTS.        THE GUERNSEY-ROCKPORT INTERCONNECT POINT (35 MILES UPSTREAM OF STERLING) SEGMENT WAS ISOLATED BY 02:54, 23 MINUTES AFTER AOC IDENTIFICATION.   FIELD OPERATIONS CONTINUED SYSTEMATIC VALVE CLOSURES AS THEY MOVED ALONG THE PIPELINE TOWARDS THE RUPTURE; THE LOCAL 15.9 MILE VALVE-TO-VALVE SEGMENT WITH THE RUPTURED SECTION WAS ISOLATED BY 06:29.  FIELD OPERATIONS SUPERVISED AN INTENTIONAL AND CONTROLLED BLOWDOWN OF THE LOCAL SEGMENT UNTIL IT WAS SAFE TO APPROACH THE RUPTURE SITE TO BEGIN INVESTIGATION.      FIELD INVESTIGATION REVEALED A CATASTROPHIC RUPTURE OF A PIPE SECTION APPROXIMATELY 45 FEET IN LENGTH, WITH COMPLETE SEPARATION OF THE RUPTURED SECTION FROM THE PIPELINE.  THE FRAGMENTS OF THE PIPE (API-5L X52, EFW, MANUFACTURED IN 1954 BY AO SMITH) WERE SENT TO A METALLURGICAL FIRM FOR STUDY.    METALLOGRAPHY DETERMINED THAT THE RUPTURE ORIGINATED IN A ""HARD SPOT"" MILL DEFECT IN THE BODY WALL. THE SEAM AND GIRTH WELDS WERE NOT PART OF THE ROOT CAUSE.    THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON MAY 9, 2013 UNDER A TEMPORARY PRESSURE RESTRICTION OF 676 PSIG (80% OF THE OPERATING FAILURE PRESSURE)."

MR. WEISS INDICATED THAT EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WERE ON-SITE AND THAT THEY HAD BLOCKED OFF A SECTION OF THE ROAD. HE INDICATED THAT THERE WERE NO RESIDENCES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA. A REPRENTATIVE FROM MIDWEST NATURAL GAS CALLED TO CONFIRM THAT NATURAL GAS APPEARED TO BE BLOWING FROM VENT CASINGS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD. THE LOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY FOUR MILES WEST OF THE TOWN OF MONDOVI, WISCONSIN. NORTHERN COMPANY EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE AND A GAS MANAGEMENT PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO REDUCE PRESSURE ON THE THE PIPELINE TO APPROXIMATELY 520-550 PSIG FROM A TYPICAL 795 PSIG. PRESSURE WAS REDUCED BY PINCHING BLOCK VALVES AND LETTING CUSTOMER USAGE PULL THE PRESSURE DOWN ON THE LINE THEN CLOSELY MONITORING. EMERGENCY STOPPLE AND BYPASS PIPING WAS BROUGHT ON-SITE TESTED AND PLACED IN-SERVICE. MICHELS CONSTRUCTION, A CONTRACTOR, ASSISTED WITH EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES ON BOTH SIDE OF THE ROAD. UPON COMPLETION OF EXCAVATION A CRACK IN A PIPING GIRTH WELD WAS FOUND ON THE UNDER SIDE (SIX O'CLOCK POSITION) WHICH WENT ENTIRELY THROUGH THE PIPE, THE CRACK WAS APPROXIMATELY 4 1/2 INCHES LONG AND ONE SIXTEENTH OF AN INCH WIDE. THE STEELE COUNTY ROAD DEPARTMENT WAS CONTACTED AND AGREED THAT NORTHERN COULD OPEN CUT THE ROAD FOR INSTALLING NEW TESTED PIPE. NORTHEN WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR RESTORATION OF THE ROAD AND HARD SURFACING. APPROXIMATELY 60-FEET OF NEW TESTED, COATED PIPE WAS INSTALLED. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO FIRE, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. THE PIPE WITH THE CRACKED GIRTH WELD WAS SENT TO AN OUTSIDE METALLURGICAL LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN RESULTS FROM THE METALLURICAL LABORATORY TESTS ARE RECEIVED AND A TOTAL COST OF THE REPAIRS IS COMPLILED. SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT (REFERENCE INITIAL REPORT 20130040 - 15978 DATED 05/13/2013 - THE FINAL COST FOR THIS EVENT HAS BEEN UPDATED. A METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED BY BRYAN LABORATORY, INC. WITH FINDINGS OF THAT THE PIPE AT BOTH GIRTH WELDS EXAMINED WERE FOUND TO EXHIBIT MISALIGNMENT AND APPEAR TO BE DISTORTED. EXTRANEOUS WELDING WIRE WAS NOTED PROTRUDING FROM THE INTERNAL PORTIONS OF THE WELD. THE CRACK WAS FOUND TO BE 6-INCHES LONG AND IN THE LOWER QUADRANT OF THE WELD. ""NECKING DOWN"", TYPICAL OF DUCTILE OVERLOADING FRATURING, WAS NOTED IN THE PIPE ON THE INTERNAL SURFACE OF THE CRACKED AREA. IN THE LABORATORIES OPINION, THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY BENDING FORCES, AS SHOWN BY THE DISTORTION OF THE PIPE AT THE GIRTH WELD. BLACK DEPOSITS ALONG BOTH SIDES OF THE CRACK AT THE OUTSIDE SURFACE SHOWED THAT A CRACK APPROXIMATELY 0.025 INCHES DEEP PRECEDED FINAL SEPARATION. FINAL SEPARATION INITIATED AT THE PREEXISTING CRACK AND FINAL SEPARATION WAS BY DUCTILE OVERLOAD. A COPY OF THE METALLURICAL REPORT IS ATTACHED."

A REVIEW OF THE STATION CONTROLLER LOG AT THE ADA COMPRESSOR STATION INDICATED THAT THE OEM FITTING FAILED AT 00:17 A.M., WHICH ALLOWED GAS TO VENT FOR 6 HOURS AND 45 MINUTES.  THE EVENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NRC IN ANTICIPATION OF GAS LOSS EXCEEDING THE 3,000 MCF THRESHOLD LEVEL. A NEW FITTING WAS INSTALLED TO REPLACE THE FAILED FITTING AND THE COMPRESSOR WAS RESTORED TO NORMAL SERVICE THE SAME DAY. THE FAILED FITTING WAS SENT TO SHERRY LABS FOR A FAILURE ANALYSIS. THE FAILURES ANALYSIS CONCLUDED THE RELIEF VALVE FITTING FRACTURED THROUGH THE 1/2"" DIAMETER THREADS OF ONE END BY UNIAXIAL BENDING FATIGUE. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF FAILURE APPREARED TO BE USE OF A MATERIAL WITH INSUFFICIENT FATIGUE RESISTANT FOR THE APPLICATION. THE FAILED FITTING WAS A OEM STANDARD SUPPLIED FITTING, WHICH IS PART OF THE PILOT SENSING SYSTEM. THE OEM HAS DESIGNED A NEW HIGH STRENGTH, STAINLESS STEEL COMPONENT WHICH WILL REPLACE THOSE EXISTING PILOTS WITH SIMILAR RELIEF PILOT INSTALLATIONS. THIS WORK WILL BE COMPLETED IN 2013.

ON TUESDAY, MARCH 12, 2013 WHEN HE SMELLED A GAS ODOR AND HEARD GAS LEAKING.  THIS EMPLOYEE IS A QUALIFIED FIRST RESPONDER AND IMMEDIATELY REQUESTED POLICE, FIRE, AND A GAS CONSTRUCTION CREW BE DISPATCHED TO THE SITE.  (DATA FROM A PRESSURE RECORDER ON THE LINE INDICATES THAT THE LINE BREAK OCCURRED AT APPROXIMATELY 8:30 A.M. ON SUNDAY, MARCH 10, 2013.)  WHEN AN IPL GAS CREW RESPONDED TO THE LEAK, THEY WERE INFORMED BY THE NEIGHBORING CHEMICAL PLANT PERSONNEL THAT THE PIPELINE HAS BEEN ENCROACHED UPON BY CONTAMINATED SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AND WAS NOW IN AN EPA SUPERFUND SITE.  ONLY QUALIFIED HAZWOPER PERSONNEL ARE ALLOWED TO WORK ON THE SITE, REQUIRING IPL TO LOCATE AND MOBILIZE AN OUTSIDE GAS CONTRACTOR WITH THESE SPECIALIZED QUALIFICATIONS TO PERFORM THE REPAIRS.  THE LINE IS A RADIAL FEED TO A SMALL TOWN WITH 190 CUSTOMERS AND THE LEAK WAS LOCATED ON A RURAL ROAD IN A RELATIVELY REMOTE LOCATION THAT DID NOT PRESENT AN IMMEDIATE RISK TO THE PUBLIC.  IN ORDER TO AVOID AN INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE TO THE ENTIRE TOWN DURING COLD WEATHER, A TEMPORARY, ABOVEGROUND BYPASS LINE WAS INSTALLED.  AFTER THE BYPASS STOPPERS WERE WELDED ON IN AN AREA OUTSIDE OF THE CONTAMINATED SOIL, A 2,600 FOOT LONG 2 INCH DIAMETER 100 PSIG HDPE ABOVEGROUND BYPASS LINE WAS CONSTRUCTED AND PLACED INTO SERVICE AT 11:54 P.M. ON WEDNESDAY, MARCH 13, 2013.  AT THAT POINT, THE REPAIR CONTRACTOR MOVED IN AND MADE THE REPAIRS TO THE DAMAGED LINE BY CUTTING OUT AND REPLACING A 20 FOOT SECTION OF PIPE. THE LOST GAS CALCULATION FROM SUNDAY AT 8:30 A.M. UNTIL WEDNESDAY AT 11:54 P.M. YIELDED A VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY 6,000 MCF, WHICH EXCEEDED THE INCIDENT REPORTING THRESHOLD.      THE LINE APPEARS TO HAVE FAILED FROM STRESS CRACKING AS A RESULT OF DENTS CAUSED BY PREVIOUS THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION DAMAGE.  A STORM SEWER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT WAS COMPLETED IN THIS IMMEDIATE AREA DURING SUMMER 2011 AND THE DENTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE TEETH OF A BACKHOE/TRACKHOE BUCKET.  LEGAL ACTION TO RECOVER THE $245,000 ESTIMATED COST OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE, REPAIR, AND LOST GAS IS PENDING.    THE CONTAMINANTS IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER ARE VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) AND POLYNUCLEAR AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS), BUT DO NOT APPEAR TO HAVE HAD A HARMFUL EFFECT ON EITHER THE COAL TAR ENAMEL COATING OR THE PIPE.  CATHODIC PROTECTION READINGS ON THE LINE HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN VERY GOOD.  DISCUSSIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE REGARDING RE-ROUTING THE PIPELINE AWAY FROM ITS EXISTING LOCATION, BUT NO FIRM PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AT THIS TIME.    ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION AS REQUESTED BY OPS CENTRAL REGION OFFICE.  WHERE APPROPRIATE, CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE QUESTIONS REFERENCED:  C6 - SELECTION IS LEFT AS RUPTURE, RATHER THAN PUNCTURE.  INITIAL DAMAGE DID NOT PIERCE THROUGH THE PIPE WALL, BUT CAUSED A DENT THAT CREATED A STRESS CONCENTRATOR THAT EVENTUALLY CAUSED THE PIPE TO FAIL CIRCUMFERENTIALLY.  E5A AND E5B - VALVES WERE NOT USED TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGE.  HOWEVER, TWO MUELLER ANSI 600 TWO PIECE LINE STOPPERS WERE INSTALLED TO UTILIZE A BYPASS LINE TO AVOID A CUSTOMER OUTAGE.  IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN ANSWER FOR QUESTIONS E5A AND E5B, ""MANUAL"" VALVE WAS SELECTED.  G14 AND G15 - IPL PERSONNEL WERE PRESENT WHEN THE LINE WAS INITIALLY EXPOSED IN 2011 FOR THE SEWER PROJECT, AND THE LOCATE MARKS WERE ACCURATE AT THAT TIME.  G16 - DID THE DAMAGE CAUSE AN INTERRUPTION IN SERVICE? THIS QUESTION APPEARS ON THE PRINTED VERSION OF THE REPORT, BUT IS ABSENT ON THE ONLINE ENTRY FORM.  THE CORRECT ANSWER IS ""NO"".  G17 - CGA FIRST AND SECOND LEVEL DIRT ROOT CAUSES:  RESPONSES WERE REVISED TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE ROOT CAUSE - EXCAVATION PRACTICES NOT SUFFICIENT AND FAILURE TO MAINTAIN CLEARANCE."

BECAUSE THERE ARE MULTIPLE FOREIGN PIPELINES IN THAT AREA, IT WAS NOT IMMEDIATELY CLEAR TO WHICH LINE THE SHEEN RELATED. NEVERTHELESS, OUT OF CAUTION, COLUMBIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL PERSONNEL REPORTED THE SHEEN TO THE NRC REPORT NO. 1036464 AND CERTAIN LOUISIANA AGENCIES AS APPROPRIATE. COLUMBIA CONTINUED ITS INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE IF THERE WAS IN FACT A LEAK AND IF SO WHETHER SUCH LEAK WAS IN A COLUMBIA GULF OWNED PIPELINE. ATTENTION FOCUSED ON A SMALL AMOUNT OF BUBBLES REACHING THE SURFACE. FOREIGN PIPELINES WERE BLOWN DOWN BY THEIR RESPECTIVE OPERATORS. FEW BUBBLES REMAINED, ENABLING COLUMBIA TO CONCLUDE THAT ITS ABANDONED LINE BW-200 COULD BE THE SOURCE OF THE BUBBLES. NITROGEN WAS INJECTED INTO THE PIPELINE IN ORDER TO LOCATE PRECISELY IF THERE WAS A LEAK AND WHERE THE LEAK WAS LOCATED.     DIVERS WERE MOBILIZED TO EXCAVATE THE PIPELINE, LOCATE THE LEAK ON THE PIPELINE SURFACE AND IMPLEMENT REPAIRS. THIS REPAIR CONSISTED OF INSTALLING A 36-IN PRE-TESTED BOLT-ON CLAMP WHERE COLUMBIA TREATED THIS PIPELINE AS AN ACTIVE LINE RATHER THAN ABANDONED. FOLLOWING THE REPAIR, NO FURTHER BUBBLES WERE PRESENT FROM THIS LOCATION. WHILE TESTING THE REPAIR TO ENSURE ITS EFFECTIVENESS, SOME BUBBLING WAS NOTICED APPROXIMATELY 80 FEET SOUTH OF THE REPAIR LOCATION NEAR BUT NOT NECESSARILY ON THE SAME PIPELINE. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF ANY SUBSTANCE BEING RELEASED WITH THOSE BUBBLES. THIS SECOND AREA WAS EXCAVATED AND NITROGEN INJECTED INTO THE LINE. THE PRESSURE WAS HELD FOR 2 HOURS WITH NO EVIDENCE OF BUBBLING AND NO PRESSURE DROP. THE DIVER DID NOT OBSERVE ANY EVIDENCE OF A LEAK. BOTH EXCAVATION AREAS WERE BACKFILLED. COLUMBIA WILL RE-INSPECT THE AREA AFTER ALLOWING TIME FOR NORMAL SETTLING IN THE EXCAVATED AREAS (AT BOTH SITES) TO ENSURE THERE IS ADEQUATE COVER OVER THE PIPELINE AS WELL AS TO ENSURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PREVIOUS SHEEN REMOVAL EFFORTS.     ORIGINAL PLANS WERE TO PIG THE LINE IN 2013. FOLLOWING ANALYSIS OF THE SITUATION, A DECISION WAS MADE NOT TO PIG AT THAT TIME. THE PIPELINE IS BEING MONITORED TO ENSURE THE CONDITIONS WHICH LED TO THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE ARE NOT REPEATED. IF CONCERNS ARISE BASED ON COLUMBIA GULF INSPECTIONS, PIPELINE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WILL TAKE NECESSARY ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION, WHICH MAY INCLUDE PIGGING."

ENGINEERING ANALYZED THE AREA AND CONCLUDED THAT THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY HARMONIC VIBRATION. TO RESOLVE THE VIBRATION ISSUE, THE SADDLE WAS REMOVED AND A 24"" X 12"" SPLIT TEE WAS INSTALLED TO SUPPORT THE BLOW LINE, VALVE, AND ACCUATOR. THE BLOWDOWN STACK WAS AS ALSO SHORTENED TO MITIGATE VIBRATION. THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED ON JANUARY 9, 2013 AFTER IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE REPAIR COSTS EXCEEDED THE 50 THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD."

IN ADDITION TO THE PUBLIC, THE CITY OFFICIALS FROM GOLDSMITH WERE NOTIFIED OF THE PENDING TEST.  THE PLAN INCLUDED ISOLATION OF THE TEST SEGMENT AND RAISING THE PRESSURE PROFILE OF THE PIPELINE. THE PLAN WAS TO RAISE PRESSURE WITHIN THE PIPELINE TO A POINT JUST BELOW 610 PSIG (MAOP) ON THE DAY PRIOR TO TEST. COMPRESSION AT MARTIN COUNTY #3 WAS THE PRESSURE SOURCE. THE DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM WAS BEING MONITORED AT MARTIN COUNTY #3, AT APPROXIMATELY 17:45, THE PRESSURE AT A DELIVERY POINT ON THE WEST END OF THE SYSTEM WAS 499 PSIA.

A PVR OPERATOR AND THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT RESPONDED TO THE FACILITY.  THE INCIDENT LASTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 30 MINUTES BEFORE THE LOCAL OPERATOR MANUALLY CLOSED THE BLOCK VALVE UNDER THE RELIEF VALVE TO STOP THE GAS FROM VENTING. SINCE NATURAL GAS IS LIGHTER THAN AIR, THE RELEASED VOLUME QUICKLY DISSIPATED WITHOUT ANY RISK TO THE PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENT, OR EMPLOYEES.     AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION TEAM DETERMINED THAT THE PRESENCE OF ICE IN THE PILOT SENSING LINE OF THE VALVE WAS LIKELY THE CAUSE OF THE EQUIPMENT MALFUNCTION.  THE VALVE WAS SENT TO A THIRD PARTY FOR FURTHER INSPECTION AND ANALYSIS.  THE THIRD PARTY COULD NOT DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE WHETHER ICE RESULTED IN THE MALFUNCTION.  HOWEVER, THE REPORT DOES STATE THAT ICE COULD HAVE VERY WELL BEEN THE PRIMARY CAUSAL FACTOR.

PIPELINE INSPECTORS VISITED THE SITE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ON 10/31/2012 TO VERIFY THE LEAK AND TO DETERMINE IF IT WAS ON PPG'S ETHYLENE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 16:45 ON 10/31/2012 OPERATIONS BEGAN DEPRESSURIZING THE ETHYLENE PIPELINE WHICH CONTINUED UNTIL 11/5/2012 WHEN PURGING WITH NITROGEN BEGAN.  PURGING AND DEPRESSURIZATION TO ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE WAS COMPLETE ON 11/7/2012.    THE LEAK SITE WAS THEN EXCAVATED AND THE SECTION OF LEAKING PIPE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH NEW 8 INCH, 0.219 WT, GRADE B X42, FBE COATED, PRESSURE TESTED PIPE.  A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION DUE TO INDUCED AC CURRENT ON THE PIPELINE AND A SMALL AREA OF DAMAGE TO THE PIPE COATING WHICH EXPOSED THE STEEL PIPE.  THE DAMAGE TO THE PIPE COATING WAS THEORIZED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A PROBE STRIKE THAT OCCURRED WHEN SOMEONE WAS LOCATING THE PIPELINE.  THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO SERVICE ON 11/11/2012.    AT THE TIME OF THE LEAK PPG PIPELINE SUPERVISION DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE SITUATION MET THE DEFINITION OF AN INCIDENT AS DEFINED BY 49 CFR 191.3; THE LEAK OCCURRED IN A VERY REMOTE AREA IN THE CALCASIEU PARISH MARSH (AT LEAST 5 MILES TO THE NEAREST DWELLING), THERE WERE NO DEATHS OR INJURIES, NO EXPLOSION OR FIRE, AND ACTUAL CALCULATED GAS LOST WAS 866 MCF (WELL BELOW THE 3 MILLION CUBIC FEET DEFINED AS AN INCIDENT).  THE ONLY DIRECT PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS TO A SECTION OF 8 INCH UNDERGROUND PIPING AND THAT REPAIR WAS ESTIMATED TO BE LESS THAN $50,000.  THEREFORE, BASED ON THIS INFORMATION, IT WAS CONCLUDED BY PPG'S PIPELINE SUPERVISION THAT NOTIFICATION TO THE NRC WAS NOT REQUIRED AND SUBMISSION OF AN ELECTRONIC WRITTEN REPORT TO PHMSA WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE EVENT WAS NOT REQUIRED.    THIS YEAR PPG'S PIPELINE SUPERVISOR ATTENDED A THIRD PARTY DOT PIPELINE COMPLIANCE TRAINING CLASS AND WAS INFORMED THAT PROPERTY DAMAGE INCLUDED ALL COST ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRING A LEAK; NOT JUST THE COST FOR THE IMMEDIATE REPAIR TO THE PIPE.  AFTER RETURNING TO HIS WORK LOCATION, THE PIPELINE SUPERVISOR LOCATED AN ADVISORY BULLETIN (ADB-02-01) RELEVANT TO THE ISSUE.  WITH THE BENEFIT OF THIS ADDITIONAL UNDERSTANDING, THE PPG PIPELINE SUPERVISOR RE-EVALUATED ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REPAIR AND REVALUED THE PROPERTY DAMAGE AS EXCEEDING THE $50,000 THRESHOLD."

DAMAGE FROM THIS HEAVY, EARLY SEASON SNOWSTORM IN THE WEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS INCLUDED LOSS OF POWER AND COMMUNICATIONS FOR MUCH OF THE REGION.  AMONG THE FACILITIES AFFECTED IN THE REGION WAS THE FLAT TOP COMPRESSOR STATION.  AT THE TIME THE STORM HIT, THE COMPRESSOR STATION WAS UNATTENDED.  WHEN THE COMMUNICATION LOSS WAS RECOGNIZED ON THE MORNING OF OCTOBER 30, AN EMPLOYEE WAS DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION TO INVESTIGATE.  THE EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT THE STATION AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 A.M.  NOT LONG AFTER ARRIVAL, HE HEARD GAS VENTING.  THIS WAS NOT UNUSUAL, AS THE TURBINE UNIT IS DESIGNED TO BLOW DOWN IF IT GOES OFFLINE AS HAD APPARENTLY HAPPENED.  A SHORT WHILE LATER, AS THE EMPLOYEE CONTINUED TO RESTORE STATION OPERATION, HE RECOGNIZED THAT GAS WAS STILL VENTING.  THIS WAS UNUSUAL, AS THE BLOWDOWN PROCESS SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE BY THEN, EVEN IF IT HAD BEGUN JUST PRIOR TO THE EMPLOYEE'S ARRIVAL.  AFTER CAREFULLY ASSESSING THE SITUATION, THE EMPLOYEE MANUALLY CLOSED THE BLOWDOWN VALVE.  FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT A PARTIAL ESD HAD OCCURRED DURING THE COMMUNICATION LOSS / POWER LOSS EVENT, AND THE BLOW DOWN VALVE HAD REMAINED IN THE OPEN POSITION.  ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION IS UNDERWAY TO FURTHER DETERMINE THE EXACT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT."

THE CONTRACTOR HAD UNCOVERED THE PIPELINE AND TWO CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WERE IN THE DITCH REMOVING THE OLD COATING IN PREPARATION FOR RECOATING THE PIPELINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 1015 HOURS, THE PIPELINE SPLIT OPEN LONGITUDINALLY RELEASING NATURAL GAS AND THE CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY LEFT THE DITCH.  THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO EXPLOSION, AND NO INJURIES.  THE LOCAL SHERIFF WAS NOTIFIED AND THE 5-7 NEARBY STRUCTURES WERE EVACUATED AS A PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE ONLY.  LINE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS 132 PSI WHICH WAS REDUCED TO 84 PSI TO MINIMIZE HAZARDS.  INITIAL GAS LOSS CALCULATIONS AND ESTIMATED REPAIR COSTS WERE DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN REPORTABLE LIMITS.  THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS WAS PROVIDED A COURTESY CALL AT 1236 HOURS.  FURTHER ASSESSMENT OF THE DAMAGED PIPE RESULTED IN A DECISION TO REPAIR VIA PIPE REPLACEMENT.  THIS WOULD CAUSE A LOSS OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE DOWNSTREAM OF THE INCIDENT SITE TO THE TOWN OF STANTON WITH AN ESTIMATED 850 CUSTOMERS.  THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER WAS PROVIDED A COURTESY CALL AT 1454 HOURS (INCIDENT NUMBER 1027378) BASED ON THE LOSS OF SERVICE TO THE TOWN OF STANTON.  THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF TEXAS WAS NOTIFIED OF THE NRC INCIDENT NUMBER (TEXAS INCIDENT NUMBER 755).  THE TOWN OF STANTON WENT DOWN AT 1430 HOURS IN PREPARATION FOR THE PIPE REPLACEMENT.  REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AND EVACUATED STRUCTURES RELEASED FOR OCCUPANCY BY 1900 HOURS THE SAME DAY.  FULL SERVICE TO ALL CUSTOMERS AND APPROVAL TO RELIGHT OCCURRED AT 2145 HOURS.  THE DELAY BETWEEN THE COMPLETION OF THE PIPE REPAIR AND RELIGHT WAS BECAUSE A SMALL 2 INCH METER HAD TO BE UTILIZED TO PRESSURE UP THE LINE AND IT TOOK SOME TIME TO ACHIEVE FULL LINE PRESSURE.  FURTHER REFINED GAS LOSS CALCULATION RESULTS CAUSED THIS INCIDENT TO BECOME REPORTABLE BASED ON GREATER THAN 3 MMCF UNINTENTIONAL RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE ENTIRE JOINT OF PIPE WHERE THE SPLIT OCCURRED WAS REPLACED (TOTAL OF 23.5 FEET).  A FAILURE ANALYSIS IS IN PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE RUPTURE.    UPDATE:  FAILURE ANALYSIS BY EXTERNAL THIRD PARTY WAS INCONCLUSIVE SO THE CAUSE OF THE LONG SEAM WELD FAILURE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED.  IN ADDITION TO THE FAILURE ANALYSIS OF THE FAILED LONGITUDINAL SEAM, A SEGMENT FROM THE SAME JOINT OF PIPE ADJACENT TO THE SEAM FAILURE PORTION WAS HYDROTESTED TO FAILURE AT 1500+ PSIG.  PART G5 AMENDED TO REFLECT THIS.  THE INCIDENT COSTS AND AUTHORIZED SIGNATURE INFORMATION WERE ALSO UPDATED.  THIS IS A SUPPLEMENTAL AND FINAL INCIDENT REPORT."

PG&E WAS PERFORMING CLEARANCE WORK FOR A HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TEST ON LINE 109.  A CANUS INSPECTOR WAS HIRED TO PERFORM STAND-BY DUTIES AND A SNELSON OPERATOR WAS HIRED TO EXCAVATE A BELL HOLE IN PREPARATION OF INSTALLING A 22-INCH ISOLATION CAP FOR THE 20 MILE CLEARANCE.  THE CANUS EMPLOYEE, ALLOWED THE SNELSON OPERATOR TO DIG WITH AN EXCAVATOR, WITHIN TWO FEET OF THE 22-INCH PIPELINE, WHEN THE OPERATOR STRUCK AN ABANDONED 3/4-INCH TEE OFF OF LINE 109.  THE CREW HAD PROPERLY IDENTIFIED THE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE, BUT THE CANUS STAND-BY INSPECTOR FAILED TO DIRECT THE OPERATOR TO FULLY EXPOSE AND PROTECT THE PIPE PRIOR TO USING AN EXCAVATOR.  THE CANUS EMPLOYEE WAS OPERATOR QUALIFIED TO PERFORMED STAND BY ON THE PIPELINE, BUT VIOLATED PROPER WORK PROCEDURES AND WAS TERMINATED FROM THE JOB.  WHEN THE INCIDENT OCCURRED, WORKERS WERE EVACUATED FROM THE SITE AND THE AREA WAS BLOCKED OFF.  BECAUSE PG&E WAS IN THE PROCESS OF PREPARING A CLEARANCE TO BLOW THE LINE DOWN, THE AREA WAS MADE SAFE AND PG&E ALLOWED THE GAS TO CONTINUE TO VENT TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  PG&E'S LOCAL EMERGENCY OPERATIONS CENTER (EOC) OPENED ON-SITE ON OCTOBER 5, 2012 AND REMAINED NEAR THE SITE OF THE DIG IN WHERE GAS WAS VENTING TO ATMOSPHERE UNTIL THE FLOW OF GAS WAS STOPPED ON OCTOBER 5, 2012 AT 2000 HOURS.  AT THAT TIME, THE LINE WAS ISOLATED AND THE END CAPS WERE WELDED ON IN PREPARATION FOR THE HYDROSTATIC PRESSURE TEST.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO FATALITIES AND NO IGNITION AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT. NO CUSTOMERS EXPERIENCED SERVICE INTERRUPTION. DAMAGES ARE LESS THAN $50,000.  THIS INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE CPUC AND DOT WHEN THE AMOUNT OF GAS RELEASED WAS DETERMINED TO BE UNINTENTIONAL AND GREATER THAN 3 MMCF.    PG&E HAS DETERMINED THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT TO BE FAILURE TO VERIFY PROPER OPERATION, TOOLS AND PROCEDURAL DISREGARD.  PG&E'S WP 4412P-05 ATTACHMENT 1 STATES THAT POWER EXCAVATION IS NOT PERMITTED WITHIN 12-INCHES OF THE FACILITY.  THE POWER EQUIPMENT STRUCK THE AFFECTED TEE FITTING 4-INCHES FROM THE GAS PIPELINE. THE CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR THIS INCIDENT WAS FOR GAS TRANSMISSION CONSTRUCTION AND PSEP (SAFETY) TO DISCUSS THE INCIDNET WITH SNELSON AND CANUS SAFETY SUPERVISION WITH EMPHASIS ON NON-ADHERENCE TO PG&E (WP 4412P-05 AND WP 4412P-05 ATTACHMENT #1) AND USA NORTH'S CONSTRUCTION MANUAL: GENERAL EXCAVATION INFORMATION PROCEDURES.

NEW VALVE ASSEMBLIES, WITH WEATHER ENCLOSURES PROTECTING THE PILOT VALVE AS WELL AS THE CONTROLLER, WERE THEN ORDERED FOR VALVE 613 AND THREE OTHER SIMILAR VALES AT THE STATION.

THE BIFFI 745 PILOT CONTROL VALVE WAS TESTED PER THESE VERBAL INSTRUCTIONS.  NO DEFECTS WERE FOUND DURING TESTING, AND THE VALVE WAS PLACED BACK IN SERVICE.  AN INVESTIGATION TEAM WAS SUBSEQUENTLY FORMED TO EVALUATE THE INCIDENT; THE TEAM CONVENED SEPTEMBER 5TH, 2012.  AS A RESULT OF THIS INVESTIGATION, THE PILOT CONTROL VALVE WAS TO BE REMOVED AND SENT FOR FURTHER TESTING ON SEPTEMBER 7TH, 2012, AT WHICH POINT A SECOND VENTING INCIDENT OCCURRED (NRC REPORT #1023618).  THE VENDOR (WILSON VALVE SPECIALTIES) WAS CONTACTED AGAIN BY INVESTIGATION TEAM MEMBERS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WERE AWARE OF SUCH INCIDENTS ON SIMILAR BLOWDOWN VALVES.  THEY INDICATED ONE SUCH VENTING INCIDENT IN WISCONSIN, AND INDICATED THAT A MODIFICATION HAD BEEN SUBSEQUENTLY MADE TO THE VALVE IN QUESTION TO HOUSE THE PILOT VALVE IN A WEATHER-TIGHT ENCLOSURE IN ORDER TO PROTECT IT FROM WEATHER CONDITIONS.  NEW VALVE ASSEMBLIES, WITH WEATHER ENCLOSURES PROTECTING THE PILOT VALVE AS WELL AS THE CONTROLLER, WERE THEN ORDERED FOR VALVE 613 AND THREE OTHER SIMILAR VALES AT THE STATION.  THESE ASSEMBLIES HAVE BEEN INSTALLED AND ALL VALVES APPEAR TO BE FUNCTIONING AS DESIGNED.    TESTING OF THE REPLACED VALVE 613 ASSEMBLY BY WILSON HAS SINCE REVEALED A SMALL SEAL LEAK ON THE BIFFI 745 PILOT CONTROL VALVE, AS WELL AS PLUGGED VENTS, WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE VENTING INCIDENTS."

THE PIPELINE FAILURE RESULTED IN A FIRE WHICH WAS EXTINGUISHED AT 10:51 A.M. LOCAL TIME WHEN THE FAILED SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED. EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM DALLAS COUNTY IOWA SECURED THE AREA UNTIL THE FIRE WENT OUT. PRESSURE ON THE LINE AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1,254 PSI. THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE OPERATING PRESSURE FOR THE PIPELINE IS 1,385 PSI. INTERNAL CORROSION IS BELIEVED TO BE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE PIPELINE FAILURE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS. TWO MIDAMERICAN ENERGY COMPANY UTILITY POWER POLES WERE DAMAGED. THE RUPTURE MEASURED APPROXIMATELY 48 FEET 4-INCHS IN LENGTH. A SECTION OF THE DAMAGED PIPE WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE RUPTURE ORIGIN. THE LINE OF FRACTURE TRAVELED LONGITUDINALLY THROUGH A SECTION OF CORRODED PIPE APPROXIMATELY 12-INCHS IN LENGTH. THE INTERNAL CORROSION OCCURRED AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION WITH ABOUT 90% WALL LOSS. THE INVESTIGATION INDICATED THE FRACTURE EXTENDING WEST FROM THE RUPTURE SITE STOPPED AT A GIRTH WELD. THE FRACTURE EAST ENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE JOINT. NO EXTERNAL CORROSION OR EVIDENCE OF THIRD-PARTY DAMAGE WAS FOUND. THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER (TICKET NUMBER 1020240) DATED 07-AUG-12. THE INCIDENT WAS ALSO REPORTED TO THE IOWA UTILITIES BOARD IN DES MOINES, IOWA AND THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION IN KANSAS CITY. ADDITIONAL INVESTIGATION IS IN PROGRESS AS WELL AS FOLLOW UP ANALYSIS BY OUTSIDE LABORATORIES.

APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES WERE CONTACTED.  THE LINE(MISSISSIPPI RIVER CROSSING #5) IS CURRENTLY INACTIVE (IDLE).  PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO BORE UNDER THE RIVER AND INSTALL A 24"" LINE.  THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY IN THE BID PROCESS AND SHOULD BE COMPLETED LAST QUARTER OF 2013.    THE CAUSE OF THE RELEASE IS A BARGE STRIKING OUR PIPELINE. THE CREW HAVE SINCE BEEN ALERTED TO THE PRESENCE OF PIPELINES IN THE AREA AND PIPELINE SAFETY IS NOW DISCUSSED DURING CREW CHANGE MEETINGS.  WE ARE WORKING WITH THE US COAST GUARD TO GET THE AREA BUOYED UNTIL WATER LEVELS RISE. WE PERFORMED A SIDE SCAN SONAR 8/17-8/20.  THE RESULTS OF THIS SCAN INDICATED THAT THIS LINE WAS EXPOSED WITHIN 60 FT OF THE WATERS EDGE, BUT NOWHERE ELSE THROUGHOUT THE LINE.     PER PHMSA REQUEST, PART C PIPE DATA HAS BEEN UPDATED.  ALSO, PART E, PART H, AND PART I HAVE BEEN UPDATED.      PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED TO BORE UNDER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND INSTALL TWO 16"" PIPELINES.  THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY WAITING ON PERMITS TO BE APPROVED BY THE U.S. ARMY COPRS OF ENGINEERS.  THIS PROJECT IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BY END OF YEAR 2015.  ONCE THE NEW PIPELINE CROSSINGS ARE IN PLACE, WE WILL ABANDON THE BRW #1 MISSISSIPPI RIVER CROSSING #5 PIPELINE."

LOCAL TIME NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY'S OPERATIONS COMMUNICATION CENTER, IN OMAHA, NE, RECEIVED A REPORT FROM THE CERRO GORDO COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OF GAS BLOWING TO ATMOSPHERE AT THE MASON CITY, IOWA TOWN BORDER STATION. AT NEARLY THE SAME TIME NORTHERN'S GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A SCADA HIGH, HIGH INLET GAS PRESSURE ALARM FOR THE FACILITY. THE SHERIFF REPORTED THAT LAW AND FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL WERE ON-SITE AND THAT THEY WERE IN THE PROCESS OF BLOCKING OFF THE ROAD, BUSINESS ROUTE HIGHWAY 18 THAT GOES BY THE TOWN BORDER STATION, AND EVACUATING SEVERAL STORES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA.  APPROXIMATELY 140 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM BUSINESSES NEAR THE TOWN BORDER STATION.    NORTHERN TECHNICIANS ARRIVED ON-SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 10:35 A.M., AND FOUND THE STATIONS INLET 4-INCH FISHER EZ RELIEF VALVE WAS VENTING.  NATURAL GAS TO THE TOWN BORDER STATION IS DELIVERED FROM THE MASON CITY IAB72002 PIPELINE, WHICH HAS A MAOP OF 800 PSI. GAS PRESSURE INTO THE TOWN BORDER STATION IS CONTROLLED BY PRESSURE CONTROLLING REGULATORS OF NATURAL GAS FROM IAB72002 AND RELIEF VALVE PROTECTED PIPING, AT A DELIVERY GAS PRESSURE OF APPROXIMATELY 330 PSI INTO THE STATION, WHICH HAS A 500 PSI MAOP. THE STATION INLET RELIEF VALVE IS SET AT 490 PSI TO PROTECT THE STATIONS 500 PSI MAOP. THE STATIONS INLET PRIMARY REGULATOR RUN WAS ISOLATED AND THE SECONDARY REGULATOR INLET RUN WAS PLACED IN-SERVICE. THE RELIEF VALVE CONTINUED TO SEEP AND IT WAS ALSO ISOLATED TO ALLOW INSPECTION. THE STREET WAS REOPENED AT APPROXIMATELY  11:10 A.M. AND BUSINESSES WERE NOTIFIED THAT THE CONDITION HAD BEEN REMEDIATED. ON INSPECTION OF THE PRIMARY REGULATOR IT WAS FOUND THAT SMALL PIECES OF WELDING SLAG AS WELL AS SMALL PIPELINE DIRT AND DEBRIS WERE PREVENTING A POSITIVE SEAL ON THE REGULATOR. THIS ALLOWED THE GAS PRESSURE TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE UNTIL THE RELIEF VALVE SET POINT WAS REACHED AND THE RELIEF OPENED RELEASING GAS TO ATMOSPHERE. IN ADDITION, TO SIMILAR SMALL AMOUNT OF DEBRIS FOUND IN THE RELIEF VALVE, A WASHED OUT AREA ON THE PILOT SEAT WAS FOUND WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELIEF VALVE NOT FULLY SEALING OFF WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE RELIEF VALVE CONTINUING TO RELEASE GAS TO ATMOSPHERE EVEN WHEN THE PRIMARY REGULATOR WAS SHUT IN AND THE BACK-UP REGULATOR WAS PLACED IN SERVICE.  THE PRIMARY REGULATOR AND THE RELIEF VALVE WERE INSPECTED, CLEANED AND REPAIRED, PILOTS REBUILT AND TESTED. REGULATOR STRAINERS DOWNSTREAM OF THE INLET REGULATION WERE ALSO CHECKED AND CLEANED OF MINIMAL DEBRIS. THE REPAIRED REGULATOR AND RELIEF SETUP WAS PLACED BACK IN-SERVICE AROUND 4:25 P.M. RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE LAST DATE OF INSPECTION ON THE REGULATORS AND RELIEF VALVE WAS COMPLETED ON JULY 18, 2012.     THIS FACILITY IS NORMALLY A BACK-UP GAS SOURCE TO THE UTILITY AND ONLY FLOWS WHEN NECESSARY IN THE HEATING MONTHS TO SUPPLEMENT GAS SUPPLIES TO THE WEST SIDE OF MASON CITY, IOWA; HOWEVER, THE FACILITY HAD BEEN PLACED INTO FULL SERVICE ON AUGUST 2, 2012, AT THE REQUEST OF ALLIANT ENERGY SO THAT MODIFICATIONS TO THEIR SYSTEM, ELSEWHERE IN THE CITY, COULD BE COMPLETED.  NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER, TICKET NUMBER 1019884, TO THE IOWA UTILITY BOARD IN DES MOINES, IOWA AND THE PIPELINE AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS SAFETY ADMINISTRATION IN KANSAS CITY. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO EXPLOSION AND NO INJURIES. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS THE QUANTITY OF GAS RELEASED EXCEEDED THE REPORTING LEVEL THRESHOLD AND THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PEOPLE EVACUATED.  10/09/2012 FILED SUPPLEMENT/FINAL PER JIM BUNN REVIEW WITH MINOR CHANGE TO LONGTIDUE READING AND CHANGING THE APPARENT CAUSE TO EQUIPMENT FAILURE.

THE EVENT SITE IS NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF CLARKSVILLE HWY AND HWY 12.    THERE WERE NO NOTED INJURIES OR FATALITIES FROM THIS EVENT.  THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT EVACUATED AREA RESIDENCES.  LANE CLOSURES DID OCCUR DUE TO DEBRIS FROM ESCAPING GAS. DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED TO AREA STRUCTURES DUE TO DEBRIS FROM THE FORCE OF THE ESCAPING GAS.  THE PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 620 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT.    GAS CONTROL NOTED THE EVENT DUE TO SCADA ALARMS.  NOTIFICATION WAS ALSO RECEIVED BY THE CALL CENTER FROM LOCAL RESIDENCES.  FIRST RESPONDERS WERE DISPATCHED BY BOTH GROUPS.  NASHVILLE OPERATIONS PERSONNEL ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND VALVED OFF THIS APPROXIMATE 2.1 MILE SECTION OF PIPELINE WHILE COORDINATING WITH GAS CONTROL TO ENSURE SYSTEM PRESSURE AND FLOW REQUIREMENTS WERE BEING MET.      NOTIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO BOTH THE TENNESSEE REGULATORY AUTHORITY (TRA) AND THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER BASED ON INITIAL ESTIMATES THAT COST WOULD EXCEED $50,000 FOR REPAIRS INCLUDING COST OF LOST GAS.    SIX RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER PREMISES WERE IMPACTED BY THE CLOSURE OF THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE.  ALL IMPACTED CUSTOMERS WERE CONTACTED TO INFORM THEM OF THE SITUATION AND EXPECTATION OF OUTAGE TIMELINES.  THERE WAS ALSO AN IMPACT TO VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN OVERALL SYSTEM PRESSURES UNTIL ALTERNATIVE FLOW PATHS OCCURRED.     LINE REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE DAMAGED SECTION OF PIPELINE.  INSTALLATION OF LAUNCHER AND RECEIVER WAS COMPLETED AND THE ENTIRE 2.1 MILES OF PIPELINE WAS SMART PIGGED WITH A CALIPER TOOL AND HYDROTESTED PRIOR TO BEING REINSTATED INTO SERVICE.  THIS WORK EFFORT WAS COMPLETED AND LINE M WAS RETURNED TO FULL SERVICE ON AUGUST 20, 2012 AT APPROXIMATELY 2:00 PM LOCAL TIME.    DNV, AN INDEPENDENT FORENSICS LABORATORY IN COLUMBUS, OHIO, INVESTIGATED THIS INCIDENT AND DETERMINED THAT MECHANICAL DAMAGE DURING ORIGINAL PIPELINE CONSTRUCTION OCCURRED AND CREATED LINEAR DENTS ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF A 23-FOOT LENGTH OF THE PIPE.

IT WAS SUSPECTED A 1949 4"" LP STEEL DISTRIBUTION MAIN LOCATED 3' SOUTH OF THE TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS THE SOURCE OF THE READINGS. TRANSMISSION CONTINGENCY CASES 16-C, 16-D WERE IDENTIFIED AND AROUND-THE-CLOCK OPERATIONS CONTINUED TO PREPARE THE DISTRIBUTION MAIN FOR INSERTION TO ELIMINATE THE TRANSMISSION MAIN AS THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK. ON WEDNESDAY MAY 23, 2012, THE DISTRIBUTION MAIN WAS ISOLATED AND THE READINGS DID NOT DISSIPATE. THE CHEMICAL TESTING LAB RESPONDED AND THEIR ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS. AN OPERATIONAL PLAN WAS DEVELOPED IDENTIFYING THE STEPS TO BE TAKEN TO ISOLATE THE SECTION OF TRANSMISSION MAIN INVOLVED AND REDUCE PRESSURE TO HIGH PRESSURE IN ORDER TO EXCAVATE AND FURTHER IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF THE LEAK.  OPERATIONS WERE DELAYED DUE TO A SECOND, UNRELATED LEAK ALONG THE ROUTE OF THE 24"" TRANSMISSION MAIN IN SCARSDALE, N.Y. WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY STAFFED AND WORKED AROUND-THE-CLOCK IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY OF MULTIPLE SECTIONS OF THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM BEING ISOLATED AT THE SAME TIME. THE SECOND LEAK WAS CONFIRMED ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT 18:00 AND THE OPERATIONAL PLAN ASSOCIATED WITH V-25962 REMAINED IN EFFECT. ON THURSDAY MAY 24, 2012 AT 07:17 ISOLATION OF THE AFFECTED SECTION OF TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS ACHIEVED AND PRESSURE REDUCED FROM 230 PSI TO 67 PSI PER PROCEDURE. AROUND-THE-CLOCK OPERATIONS CONTINUED AND EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES BEGAN FOR REPLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 38' OF TRANSMISSION MAIN.  ON SUNDAY MAY 27, 2012, AT 07:22 THE INSTALLATION OF  38' 2"" OF 24"" PIPE AND ALL WELDING WAS COMPLETED, TESTING PASSED AND PRESSURE RESTORATION BEGAN PER PROCEDURE. LEAK SURVEY MONITORED THE AFFECTED SECTION DURING RESTORATION ACTIVITIES AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND AT 10:45 THE SECTION OF MAIN WAS FULLY ENERGIZED AND NORMAL SYSTEM CONDITIONS RESUMED (226 PSI).  THERE WERE NO INJURIES, EVACUATIONS OR MEDIA ATTENTION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS INCIDENT. THE NYS PSC AND US DOT WERE NOTIFIED AND THE PSC RESPONDED TO LOCATION SEVERAL TIMES DURING THIS PROJECT.

AT APPROXIMATELY 1630 HOURS ON APRIL 27, 2012, A FIELD TILE INSTALLATION CREW WORKING FOR KUNDE DOZING AND TILING STRUCK AND PUNCTURED A 16-INCH, 960 PSIG MAOP NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE, OWNED AND OPERATED BY MIDAMERICAN ENERGY COMPANY, IN JACKSON COUNTY, IOWA.  THE DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE RESULTED IN A RUPTURE THAT SUBSEQUENTLY IGNITED.  THE PIPELINE WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 640 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.    MIDAMERICAN'S GAS SYSTEM CONTROL CENTER RECEIVED A LOW PRESSURE ALARM AT 1635 HOURS FROM THE SCADA EQUIPMENT LOCATED AT THE PIPELINE TAP LOCATION NEAR DUBUQUE, IOWA.  THE MAQUOKETA LAW CENTER RECEIVED A 911 CALL AT 1631 HOURS FROM A RESIDENT REPORTING AN APPARENT PIPELINE BREAK AND FIRE.  THE MAQUOKETA LAW CENTER REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO MIDAMERICAN AT 1649 HOURS.    MIDAMERICAN WAS ABLE TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGED SEGMENT OF THE PIPELINE BY 1730 HOURS.  THE PIPELINE WAS FURTHER ISOLATED BY 1855 HOURS AND THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED AT 1915 HOURS.    MIDAMERICAN COMPLETED EMERGENCY WORK TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGED SECTION AND RE-PRESSURIZE THE PIPELINE BY 0600 HOURS ON APRIL 28, 2012.  SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO ALL 11 RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS AFFECTED BY THE OUTAGE BY 1417 HOURS ON APRIL 28, 2012.  PERMANENT REPAIRS WERE COMPLETED AND THE PIPELINE WAS RESTORED TO NORMAL OPERATION AT 1930 HOURS ON MAY 3, 2012.    MIDAMERICAN'S INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT DETERMINED THAT THE CONTRACTOR INSTALLING THE DRAIN TILE WAS PERFORMING EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES ON AGRICULTURAL LAND WITHOUT A LOCATE REQUEST.  THE TILING CREW HAD CROSSED THE PIPELINE FOUR SEPARATE TIMES DURING THE DAY AND HIT THE LINE DURING THE FIFTH CROSSING.    THE OWNER OF THE TILING COMPANY AND IOWA ONE CALL BOTH CONFIRMED THAT NO LOCATE REQUESTS WERE MADE FOR THE INCIDENT LOCATION."

DIRECTOR PIPELINE SAFETY AND RISK	402-398-7715	thomas.correll@nngco.com	"ON MARCH 10, 2012, NORTHERN'S OPERATIONS COMMUNICATION CENTER & GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A CALL FROM A NEIGHBOR NEAR THE WATERLOO, IOWA COMPRESSOR STATION STATING THAT HE THOUGHT HE COULD HEAR GAS BLOWING AT THE COMPRESSOR STATION. GAS CONTROL IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED THE WATERLOO, IOWA COMPRESSOR PLANT TEAM ON-CALL PERSON. THE ON-CALL PERSON WAS AWARE THAT ON THURSDAY, MARCH 8, 2012, THE TEAM PERSONNEL HAD INSPECTED AND TESTED COMPRESSOR UNIT # 2'S DISCHARGE RELIEF VALVE AND HAD RESET IT FROM A PRESSURE OF 1,030 PSIG TO A SET POINT PRESSURE OF 999 PSIG. DUE TO CONCERNS THAT UNIT DISCHARGE PRESSURE PULSATIONS COULD IMPACT THE RELIEF VALVE AND CAUSE IT TO BLOW PREMATURELY, THE TEAM ALSO HAD TESTED THE PULSATION IMPACT ON THE RELIEF ON MARCH 8, 2012, BY PUTTING UNIT 2 ON-LINE AND RUNNING THE DISCHARGE PRESSURE TO 958 PSIG, WHICH IS 2 PSIG BELOW THE 960 PSIG MAOP, AND THEY DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE RELIEF VALVE BEING ACTIVATED. AS THE ON-CALL PERSON WAS AWARE OF THE PREVIOUS WORK AND CHANGES TO THE RELIEF VALVE HE WAS FAIRLY CERTAIN THAT THIS COULD BE THE CAUSE OF THE BLOWING GAS SO HE REQUESTED THAT GAS CONTROL REMOTELY SHUTDOWN UNIT # 2. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE PLANT THERE WAS NO GAS BLOWING. A REVIEW OF THE HISTORICAL PRESSURE TRENDS ON THE LOCATION HMI INDICATED THAT THE RELIEF VALVE STARTED TO VENT AT APRPOXIAMTELY 946 PSIG, WHICH IS WELL BELOW THE 999 PSIG SET POINT, AND ALSO WELL BELOW THE MAOP OF 960 PSIG. WHEN INSPECTING AND CHANGING THE SET POINT LOCATION PERSONNEL WERE AWARE THAT THE RELIEF VALVE WAS EQUIPPED WITH AN ANDERSON GREENWOOD AGCO PRESSURE SPIKE SNUBBER.IT WAS BELIEVED THAT THIS WOULD PREVENT PREMATURE ACTIVATION OF THE RELIEF VALVE. ADDITIONAL REVIEW INDICATED THAT THE UNITS WERE BEING OPERATED AT A REDUCED RATE OF SPEED AND LOAD AND THIS UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED TO DISCHARGE PRESSURE PULSATIONS, SURGES AND SPIKES THAT WERE OUTSIDE OF THE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY OF THE AGCO PRESSURE SNUBBER TO DAMPEN. ON MONDAY, MARCH 12, 2012 THE TEAM INSPECTED, RESET AND TESTED THE RELIEF VALVE AT A SET POINT OF 1,030 PSIG AND THE UNIT WAS PUT BACK INTO OPERATIONAL SERVICE. THE LOCATION IS DISCUSSING WITH THE EQUIPMENT VENDOR WHETHER THERE IS OPTIONS ON OTHER DEVICES THAT THEY MAY HAVE FOR INSTALLATION ON THE RELIEF VALVE THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR OPERATION AS AT A PRESSURE SET POINT OF 999 PSIG. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TOTAL GAS RELEASED BY THE RELIEF VALVE OPENING EXCEEDED THE THREE MILLION CUBIC FEET REPORTING THRESHOLD. NO FURTHER ACTIONS AS PENDING OR ARE REQUIRED AT THIS TIME SO THIS REPORT IS BEING CONSIDERED AS THE ORIGINAL/FINAL REPORT FOR THIS EVENT.  10/09/2012 A SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT WAS FILED ON REPORT # 20120032-15474 DATED 03/29/2012 AS A FOLLOW UP TO RECOMMENDATIONS FROM A PHMSA REVIEW.

THE RELIEF VALVE IS LOCATED DOWNSTREAM OF THE HIGH PRESSURE FUEL GAS REGULATOR 013153R AND UPSTREAM OF THE LOW PRESSURE FUEL GAS REGULATOR 013152R. THE STATION OPERATOR HAD NO INDICATION OF WHEN THE RELIEVE VALVE ACTIVATED. BASED ON THE YUMA MAINLINE PRESSURE PROFILE ON SCADA, INDICATIONS WERE THERE THAT SHOWS THAT THE RELIEF VALVE PROBABLY WAS ACTIVATED APPROXIMATELY AT 0505 ON 08 FEB 2012 AND WAS SHUT-IN AT APPROXIMATELY 0812.  AT 0820 CST THE OPERATOR CALLED GAS CONTROL TO INFORM THEM IT THE R.V. HAD GONE OFF DUE TO A FREEZE IN THE REGULATOR RUN.    NO ALARMS WERE INDICATED AT YUMA STATION OF ANY POTENTIAL MALFUNCTION. A CALL WAS PLACED TO THE NATIONAL RESPONSE CENTER AT 0923 CST ON 08 FEB 2012. THE NRC CREATED TICKET 1002451 IN RESPONSE TO THIS REPORTING.    YUMA STATION HAS A HEAT EXCHANGER THAT WARMS THE GAS BEFORE IT ENTERS THE FUEL RUN.  THERE IS ALSO A PILOT HEATER FOR THE REGULATOR INSTALLED.  DUE TO THE FACT THAT YUMA STATION WAS OFF LINE THE HEAT FROM BOTH THE HEAT EXCHANGER AND THE PILOT HEATER WERE ONLY WARMING STAGNANT GAS.  THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AT YUMA AT THE TIME OF THIS INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 0 DEGREES F.  THIS ALLOWED THE MOISTURE INSIDE THE PILOT FOR REGULATOR 13153R TO FEEZE CAUSING THE REGULATOR TO FAIL WHICH ACTIVATED THE R.V."

(II) INSTALL FILTER/DRYER ON PILOT AIR SUPPLY SYSTEM. (INSTALLED AND WAS IN OPERATION AS OF JANUARY 31, 2013.)   (III) ELIMINATE EXISTING MOISTURE IN THE ESD PILOT AIR SYSTEM. ACCUMULATED MOISTURE WAS REMOVED INTO OUTSIDE STORAGE TANKS.  SMALL ESD STORAGE TANK CHECKED, NO WATER FOUND.  PILOT AIR LINES TO BE PURGED WHEN NEW AIR SYSTEM IS INSTALLED. (COMPLETED ON DECEMBER 3, 2012.)    (IV)  TRAIN ADALINE COMPRESSOR STATION OPERATIONS PERSONNEL REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE AIR DRYING EQUIPMENT AND THE DOWNSTREAM SYSTEMS. (COMPLETED ON JANUARY 31, 2013.)"

A SMALL LEAK WAS FOUND AT THE 24 INCH WELD-END INSULATOR THAT WAS NEAR THE LADYSMITH M&R STATION.  VNG NOTIFIED THE VIRGINIA STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION OF THE FOUND LEAK AND BEGAN STAGING EQUIPMENT, MATERIAL AND LABOR TO MAKE THE REPAIR.  THE AFFECTED SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED BY CLOSING MLV-140 AND MLV-145, AND THE 2-MILE SECTION OF 24 INCH PIPELINE WAS PURGED OF GAS.  AFTER THE SECTION OF PIPELINE WAS FREE OF GAS, THE FAILED INSULATOR WAS REMOVED AND A LENGTH OF PRE-TESTED PIPE WAS INSTALLED.  THE PIPELINE WAS RE-ACTIVATED ON 01/25/12.  IT IS NOTED THAT THE WEATHER WAS MILD AND DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS HAD ALTERNATE SOURCES OF FUEL TO OPERATE AND/OR DID NOT NEED TO OPERATE.  THE FAILED 24 INCH WELD-END INSULATOR WAS SHIPPED TO AN INDEPENDENT, THIRD-PARTY LABORATORY FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION.      THE INDEPENDENT LABORATORY CONCLUDED THAT THE INSULATOR SUFFERED EITHER A SINGLE, SEVERE BENDING MOMENT OR SEVERAL, SUCCESSIVE, LESS CATASTROPHIC BENDING MOMENTS THAT CAUSED THE INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR EPOXY TO CRACK AND OPEN A PATH AT THE CENTER GASKET FOR MATERIAL TO ESCAPE.  THE ONLY KNOWN PHYSICAL OR ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR THAT COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE OF THE FITTING IS THE EARTHQUAKE THAT OCCURRED IN VIRGINIA ON AUGUST 23, 2011."

THE SEAL OIL FIRE OCCURRED ON UNIT 31, A G.E. FRAME III 9100-HORSEPOWER TURBINE COMPRESSOR, BETWEEN THE UNIT POWER TURBINE AND THE COMPRESSOR. THE FIRE AND GAS DETECTION SYSTEM DETECTED THE SEAL OIL FIRE IMMEDIATELY AND ACTIVATED THE STATION EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM, WHICH FUNCTIONED AS DESIGNED AND SAFELY SHUT DOWN THE UNIT AND THE STATION. ALL EMERGENCY VALVES TRAVELED TO THE CORRECT POSITION FOLLOWING ACTIVATION. THE ELECTRICAL POWER TO UNIT 31 WAS MANUALLY ISOLATED AND LOCKED OUT BY OPERATIONS PERSONNEL, AS IT IS NOT TRIPPED BY THE EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN SYSTEM. THIS IS BY DESIGN TO AVOID CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE TO THE TURBINES, DUE TO LACK OF LUBE OIL DURING POST-TRIP SPIN DOWN. AFTER ENSURING CONDITIONS WERE SAFE, CLIFTON VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ENTERED THE BUILDING AND EXTINGUISHED THE RESIDUAL BURNING SEAL OIL.      UNIT 31 WAS ON-LINE DECEMBER 23, 2011, WHEN THE FITTING FAILURE OCCURRED. ON DECEMBER 22, 2011, AT 3:45 P.M., OPERATIONS PERSONNEL PERFORMED A DAILY WALK THROUGH WHILE THE UNIT WAS DOWN AND NO ABNORMAL CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED. THE UNIT WAS STARTED REMOTELY BY GAS CONTROL AT 3 A.M. DECEMBER 23, 2011, AND NO WALK THROUGH WAS CONDUCTED BEFORE THE 8:58 A.M. SHUTDOWN. THE FITTING THAT FAILED IS BELIEVED TO BE PART OF THE ORIGINAL 1970 INSTALLATION.  THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS DUE TO A FAILURE IN THE THREADED 1-INCH-DIAMETER END OF A 2- TO 1-INCH-DIAMETER SWEDGE FITTING, THAT THREADED INTO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEAL OIL PRESSURE REGULATOR. THE FITTING FAILURE ALLOWED HIGH PRESSURE COMPRESSOR SEAL OIL TO SPRAY ONTO THE BACK OF THE TURBINE EXHAUST AND IGNITE.

UPON INVESTIGATING, GDS REPORTED A 20% GAS-IN-AIR READING 32' WEST OF THE BUILDING ALONG THE CURBLINE AND 60% GAS-IN-AIR READING IN A STREET PATCH IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. THE LEAK WAS CLASSIFIED A TYPE 1 DUE TO A 24"" 1948 245 PSI TRANSMISSION MAIN ON THE STREET APPROXIMATELY 2' AWAY FROM A 6"" LOW PRESSURE CAST IRON DISTRIBUTION MAIN. GAS CONSTRUCTION RESPONDED AND PERFORMED AN INVESTIGATION. AT 18:48 HRS., CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISION REPORTED TO THE GERC A PROBABLE TRANSMISSION MAIN LEAK WAS SUSPECTED OVER A 24"" COUPLING WITH A 57% READING OVER SAME. AN OPERATIONAL PLAN WAS INITIATED AND ALL OPERATING AREAS, TRANSMISSION ENGINEERING, PRESSURE CONTROL, GAS CONTROL, LEAK SURVEY, GERC AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT PARTICIPATED. A PLAN TO ISOLATE THE SECTION OF TRANSMISSION AND REDUCE PRESSURE TO APPROXIMATELY 60 PSI WAS IDENTIFIED AND ONCE REDUCED, EXCAVATION OVER THE SUSPECTED LEAKING COUPLING WOULD BEGIN. CONSTRUCTION, GDS AND PRESSURE CONTROL CREWS PROCEEDED WITH THE TRANSMISSION MAIN ISOLATION AND PRESSURE REDUCTION. OPERATIONS CONTINUED AROUND-THE-CLOCK UNTIL THE 24"" TRANSMISSION MAIN WAS EXPOSED AND A VISIBLE LEAK ON A 24"" COUPLING WAS DETECTED. A WELDED REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED TO SECURE THE LEAK. A SECOND WELDED REPAIR SLEEVE WAS INSTALLED ON THE COUPLING NORTH OF THE LEAK AS A PRECAUTION. ALL WELDS WERE X-RAYED AND APPROVED. ON SATURDAY DECEMBER 17, 2011 AT 01:30 HRS.

THE WELL WAS OPEN, THE GLYCOL REBOILER WAS OPERATING AT 375 DEGREES, AND ONE OF THE TWO GLYCOL PUMPS WAS CIRCULATING GLYCOL THROUGH THE UNIT.   STORAGE FIELD OPERATING PRESSURE WAS 1485 PSIG.    SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE FIRE, A 1/4 INCH DIAMETER TUBING LINE ON THE BOTTOM OF A GLYCOL PUMP BROKE RELEASING A GLYCOL AND GAS MIXTURE INSIDE THE DEHY UNIT BUILDING.  AT SOME POINT, THE GLYCOL AND GAS WERE IGNITED AND THE RESULTING FIRE DAMAGED THE DEHY UNIT.      THE UINTA COUNTY (WYOMING) FIRE DEPARTMENT MONITORED THE FIRE, QUESTAR PIPELINE COMPANY OPERATING PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SCENE AT 09:10 AM.  AT 09:30 AM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ASSISTED COMPANY OPERATORS IN CLOSING THE WELLHEAD WING VALVE, MASTER VALVE, AND TWO VALVES NEAR THE DEHY, THE INJECTION BLOCK VALVE AND WITHDRAWAL BLOCK VALVE.   THE VALVE ON THE PLANT END OF THE LEROY #11 STORAGE LATERAL WAS ALREADY CLOSED (NO VOLUME SET POINT).   CLOSING THESE VALVES ISOLATED PRESSURE IN THE DEHY UNIT AND PRODUCTION LINE.  THE BROKEN TUBING LINE INSIDE THE DEHY UNIT CONTINUED TO VENT GAS, AND THE FIRE CONTINUED TO BURN. A 1/2 INCH VENT VALVE ON THE PRODUCTION LINE, NEAR THE WELLHEAD ESD VALVE WAS USED TO VENT PRESSURE TO ATMOSPHERE, AND HELP LOWER THE PRESSURE ON THE DEHY PIPING.      THE CONTROL VALVE ON THE WELL #11 LATERAL AT THE LEROY PLANT WAS LOCKED OUT AND TAGGED OUT, AND THE LATERAL WAS DEPRESSURED TO 140 PSIG USING A BLOWDOWN VENT IN THE PLANT.

THIS OUTAGE REQUIRED GAS TO BE RE-ROUTED FROM NEPS AT OOLAHGA, OK DOWN L-4 TO THE L-4 TO L-4A JUNCTION AT KEETONVILLE, OK TO CONTINUE THE SUPPLY OF GAS THROUGH L-4A & L-4B TO CUSTOMERS CONNECTED TO L-4C INSIDE THE PRYOR INDUSTRIAL PARK.  ON 11/18/2011, THE CLAREMORE COMPRESSOR STATION WAS REMOVED FROM SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE OF MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT.  THIS OUTAGE ELIMINATED THE USE OF L-4A AND L-4B TO SUPPLY GAS TO L-4C; THEREBY REQUIRING THE USE OF AN ALTERNATE VALVE INSIDE THE AECI GAS YARD AT CHOTEAU, OK TO ROUTE GAS FROM L-281 INTO L-4E TO SUPPLY GAS TO CUSTOMERS CONNECTED TO L-4C INSIDE THE PRYOR INDUSTRIAL PARK.  THE FLOW OF GAS FROM L-281 INTO L-4E TO SUPPLY GAS TO L-4C HAD NOT BEEN ATTEMPTED PRIOR TO THIS DATE.  DUE TO THE GAS LOAD AT THE TWO POWER PLANTS AT AECI AND THE DEMAND REQUIRED BY CUSTOMERS IN THE PRYOR INDUSTRIAL PARK, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT PCV-281 IN THE AECI GAS YARD COULD NOT SUPPLY THE AMOUNT OF GAS NECESSARY.  XV-102, A 16' VALVE WAS OPENED BY GAS CONTROL TO BYPASS GAS FLOW AROUND PCV-281 AND SUPPLEMENT THE FLOW THROUGH PCV-281.  AT AN UNKNOWN TIME ON THE EVENING OF 11/18/2011, THE AECI POWER PLANT REDUCED THE DEMAND LOAD INTO THE POWER PLANTS.  GAS FLOW THEN TOOK THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE, WHICH WAS INTO L-4E AND L-4C.  GAS FLOW CONTINUED TO FLOW BACKWARD INTO L-4B TOWARD THE CLAREMORE COMPRESSOR STATION.  PC-6, A RECYCLE/SURGE CONTROL VALVE INSIDE THE CLAREMORE STATION, DETECTED THE INCREASING PRESSURE IN L-4B AND OPENED AT A SETPOINT OF 750 PSIG, THEREBY ROUTING GAS AROUND THE CLAREMORE STATION INTO L-4A.  THE COMPRESSOR STATION WAS NOT NEEDED AND THEREFORE NOT OPERATING AT THIS TIME.  THIS GAS FLOW CONTINUED TO FLOW INTO L-4, THUS STEADILY INCREASING THE PRESSURE IN L-4 UNTIL THE SETPOINT ON AVAILABLE OVERPRESSURE WAS SATISFIED AND THE PSV AT THE NEPS GAS YARD ACTIVATED.  THE NEPS CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR INITIALLY NOTIFIED AN ONG REPRESENTATIVE TO RESPOND TO GAS VENTING IN THE GAS YARD.  UPON ARRIVAL, THE ONG INDICATED TO THE NEPS CONTROL ROOM THAT THE GAS RELEASE WAS FROM A ENOGEX PSV.  THE NEPS CONTROL ROOM OPERATOR THEN IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED ENOGEX GAS CONTROL AT 1:40 AM.  THE ENOGEX ON-CALL PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT NEPS AT 3:00 AM AND IMMEDIATELY CONFIRMED WITH GAS CONTROL THAT THE L-4 OPERATING PRESSURE WAS 369 PSIG OR 236 PSIG BELOW THE MAOP OF 605.  THE PSV WAS THEN ISOLATED TO END THE RELEASE OF GAS AND GAS CONTROL WAS INSTRUCTED TO CLOSE XV-102 IN THE AECI GAS YARD AT CHOTEAU.  THE ENOGEX ON-CALL PERSONNEL THEN DROVE TO THE CLAREMORE COMPRESSOR STATION TO ISOLATE PV-6 TO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS INTO L-4A.  THE ENOGEX ON-CALL PERSONNEL THEN RETURNED TO NEPS TO PLACE THE PSV BACK INTO SERVICE.  AN INSPECTION OF THE PSV AT NEPS GAS YARD REVEALED MINOR SCARRING OF THE SEAT MATERIAL THAT PREVENTED THE PSV FROM AUTOMATICALLY RESEATING ONCE THE L-4 PRESSURE FELL BELOW THE PSV SETPOINT OF 605.  AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT REVEALED THAT PV-6 LOCATED IN THE CLAREMORE COMPRESSOR STATION WAS PROGRAMMED TO OPEN WHEN THE COMPRESSOR DISCHARGE PRESSURE IS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 750 PSIG.  IT WAS ALSO DETERMINED THAT THE PV-6 SURGE VALVE IS NOT NEEDED WHEN THE COMPRESSORS ARE NOT RUNNING.  A CHANGE IN THE CONTROL LOGIC PROGRAM AT THE CLAREMORE COMPRESSOR STATION IS SCHEDULED FOR DECEMBER 22, 2011 TO INTERLOCK THE OPERATION OF PV-6 WHEN THE COMPRESSORS ARE NOT RUNNING OR DURING AN ESD CONDITION.

THAT EMPLOYEE CONTACTED A SECOND COMPANY EMPLOYEE FOR ASSISTANCE AT THE STATION. THE NGT&S MONITORING CENTER WAS ALSO CONTACTED TO INFORM THEM OF THE POSSIBLE INCIDENT.    UPON CONFIRMING THE FIRE AND INITIATING AN ESD OF THE STATION, THE AREA WAS SECURED.  COMPANY PERSONNEL WORKED WITH THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND THE AREA.  IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DUMP VALVE FOR THE ARTEMAS B FIELD SLUG CATCHER HAD FAILED IN THE OPEN POSITION.  UPON CLOSING THIS VALVE, THE FIRE WAS FULLY EXTINGUISHED.    THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS BY A THIRD PARTY EXPERT IN METALLURGY AND FAILURE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT THE RUPTURE WAS LIKELY DUE TO WATER FREEZING IN THE DRAIN LINE. THE FROZEN LIQUID CAUSED THE PIPING TO EXPAND, PRODUCING DUCTILE TEARING AT INTERNAL CORROSION FEATURES. THE RESULTANT FLAW SIZE WAS CRITICAL FOR THE MATERIAL PROPERTIES, DIMENSIONS, AND OPERATING PRESSURE OF THE PIPING.    FREEZING OCCURRED SOMETIME PRIOR TO THE FAILURE.  THE PRESENCE OF THE INTERNAL CORROSION WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE.

INVESTIGATION OF THE EVENT RESULTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF A 'CAUSAL FACTORS' .  THE ELECTRONIC ESD SYSTEM AT CORNING CS WAS UNNECESSARILY ACTIVATED. THE FUEL GAS ESD BLOCK VALVE DID NOT CLOSE AS DESIGNED . SINCE THE FUEL GAS BLOCK VALVE FAILED TO CLOSE, GAS FROM THE PIPELINE WAS VENTED FOR AN EXTENDED DURATION OF TIME.  IN LIEU OF THIS INCIDENT AND ITS INVESTIGATION, SEVERAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED AND EXECUTED AS FOLLOWS:  1. THE  ETHERNET CONNECTION BETWEEN THE REMOTE I/O PANELS AND THE GUARDLOGIC PLC SHOULD BE ELIMINATED, OR A REDUNDANT ETHERNET COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE REMOTE I/O PANELS AND THE GUARDLOGIC PLC SHOULD BE INSTALLED.  HARD-WIRING THESE DEVICES MAY  PROVIDE THE HIGHEST RELIABILITY.  2. INSTALL POINT-OF-USE FILTRATION ON ALL THE ESD OPERATOR CONTROLS THAT EMPLOY  VERSA VALVES.  IN ADDITION, IMPLEMENT THE MANUFACTURER'S RECOMMENDATION TO  AVOID THE USE OF TEFLON-TAPE ON CONTROL TUBING FOR VERSA VALVES.

LEROY EDLUND OWNS THE TILING OPERATION AND OPERATES IT UNDER THE NAME LEROY EDLUND CONSTRUCTION. EDLUND WAS INSTALLING FARM DRAINAGE TILE UTILIZING A FARM TILING IMPLEMENT ATTACHED TO A 9380 CASE IH TRACTOR. THE BLADE PLOWED A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY THREE FEET DEEP. EDLUND WAS ASSISTED BY DAN THOMPSON, WHO WAS OPERATING A FARM TRACTOR STRINGING TILE IN FRONT OF THE 9380 CASE IH TRACTOR OPERATED BY EDLUND. THE PIPELINE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS 528 PSIG. THE FARM TILING IMPLEMENT STRUCK AND SEVERED THE PIPELINE AT A DEPTH OF THREE-FEET. THE ESCAPING GAS DID NOT IGNITE. EDLUND AND THOMPSON VACATED THE EQUIPMENT AND RAN OUT OF THE FIELD. EDLUND CONTRACTED NORTHERN'S OPERATION COMMUNICATION CENTER (OCC) AT 1:56 P.M. INDICATING THAT HE HAD STRUCK A PIPELINE WHILE WORKING IN THE FARM FIELD. THE MORRIS BRANCH LINE CONSISTS OF 42.23 MILES OF PIPELINE CONSISTING OF 16.45 MILES OF EIGHT-INCH X 0.188 WALL THICKNESS PIPE AND 25.78 MILES OF SIX-INCH X 0.156 WALL THICKNESS PIPE. THE PIPE THAT WAS HIT WAS SIX-INCH X 0.156 WALL THICKNESS, GRADE X-42. THE PIPE WAS COATED WITH X-TRUCOAT COATING. THE PIPELINE WAS INSTALLED IN 1967 AND HAS AN MAOP OF 975 PSIG. THERE WAS A LOSS OF SERVICE TO THE THREE COMMUNITIES OF MORRIS, BENSON AND HANCOCK, MINNESOTA. RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES IN THESE COMMUNITIES WERE TEMPORARILY OUT OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE FROM APPROXIMATELY 3:30 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2011, TO APPROXIMATELY 12:00 P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2011. CENTER POINT ENERGY, THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY, UTILIZED THEIR ODORIZED NATURAL GAS TRUCK AT THE HOSPITAL IN MORRIS, MINNESOTA TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO THEIR SANITIZING SYSTEM. CENTER POINT ENERGY HAD TO RE-LIGHT APPROXIMATELY 3,600 CUSTOMERS THAT LOST GAS SERVICE TO THE INCIDENT. REPAIRS WERE MADE BY REPLACING THE DAMAGE PIPE WITH 13-FEET AND SIX-INCHES OF SIX-INCH DIAMETER, 0.280-INCH WALL THICKNESS, X-42 PIPE COATED PIPE. THE JOINT OF PIPE WAS BACK BEVELED TO 0.219-INCH FOR TRANSITION. MIDWEST X-RAY CHECK THE PIPE FOR UT AND MAG PARTICLE FOR CRACKING AND IT CHECKED OUT OK WITH A WALL THICKNESS OF 0.155 TO 0.156 RECORDED ON THE PIPE. THE PIPE WELDS WERE X-RAY INSPECTED AND THE PIPE WAS BACKFILLED WITH SOIL PRIOR TO COMMENCING PURGING AND RE-PRESSURIZATION FOR RETURNING TO SERVICE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, NO EXPLOSION, NO FIRE AND NO EVACUATION OF PERSONNEL. WHEN ASKED ABOUT WHETHER HE HAD MADE A ONE-CALL PRIOR TO EXCAVATION, MR. EDLUND ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD NOT MADE A ONE-CALL AND ADMITTED THAT HE KNEW A ONE-CALL WAS REQUIRED PRIOR TO INITIATING EXCAVATION ACTIVITIES. THE SECTION OF DAMAGED PIPE IS BEING EXAMINED BY AN OUTSIDE SERVICES METALLURGICAL COMPANY. FILING OF AN INCIDENT REPORT WAS REQUIRED AS IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE TOTAL COST OF THE INCIDENT WILL EXCEED THE $50,000 REPORTING THRESHOLD. IN ADDITION, THE LOSS OF SERVICE TO COMMUNITIES IS CONSIDERED AS A SIGNIFICANT EVENT BY NORTHERN.  A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN ALL FINAL COST OF REPAIRS AND THE METALLURGICAL REPORT FINDINGS ARE AVAILABLE. SUPPLEMENT/FINAL REPORT - TOTAL COST OF REPAIRS HAS BEEN UPDATED TO THE FINAL CALCULATED COSTS"

THE CREW COMPLETED ALL OF THESE TASKS UP TO THE POINT OF WELDING THE SECOND LEG.  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED WHEN THE CREW WAS WELDING THE SECOND LEG.  IN ORDER TO HAVE SUFFICIENT ROOM TO PERFORM WORK ON THE SECOND LEG, THE CREW HAD REMOVED THE CRANKCASE BREATHER.  THE CREW HAD USED PORTABLE GAS DETECTORS IN AND AROUND THE WORK AREA, BUT THEY FAILED TO POSITION THE PORTABLE GAS DETECTORS INSIDE THE CRANKCASE, SO THE CREW WAS NOT AWARE THAT THERE WAS COMBUSTIBLE GAS IN THE CRANKCASE.  AFTER PERFORMING A POST-INCIDENT INVESTIGATION, IT IS BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS EXCESSIVE LEAKAGE OF THE PACKING GLAND SEALS, WHICH RESULTED IN THE GAS MIGRATING TO THE CRANKCASE."

BY A LOCAL OILFIELD OPERATOR WORKING FOR AN UNIDENTIFIED PRODUCER IN THE  AREA.  THIS OPERATOR WAS WORKING FROM A FLOAT PLANE AND FLEW OVER THE LEAK LOCATION.      GAS CONTROL CONTACTED THE LOCAL OPERATIONS PERSONNEL WHO DISPATCHED A HELICOPTER TO THE LOCATION TO VERIFY THE REPORT.  UPON ARRIVAL THE LOCAL PERSONNEL  CONFIRMED THE LEAK AND WAS ABLE TO LAND NEAR THE DOWNSTREAM VALVE SETTING AND CLOSE THE ISOLATION VALVE.  ONCE ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON LOCATION THE HELICOPTER WAS DISPATCHED OFFSHORE TO VR 26B AND THE UPSTREAM ISOLATION VALVE CLOSED AND THE PIPELINE WAS SHUT IN AT 1701 HRS. AND PRESSURIZATION PROCESS COMMENCED.     DURING THE DEPRESSURIZATION PROCESS THE PIPELINE BEGAN TO LEAK CONDENSATE.  TGC PERSONNEL IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AN LOCAL OSRO TO THE LOCATION TO ISOLATE THE RELEASE AND BEGIN CLEAN-UP OPERATIONS.    ONCE THE RELEASE WAS CONTAINED PIPELINE REPAIR RESOURCES WERE MOBILIZED AND AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO EXCAVATE THE PIPELINE. BECAUSE OF THE DEPTH OF THE PIPE AND THE UNSTABLE SOIL CONDITIONS THE DECISION WAS MADE TO BRING IN A GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING CONTRACTOR TO PERFORM SOIL ANALYSIS AND PROVIDE AN EXCAVATION SHORING SYSTEM TO MEET OSHA REGULATIONS.  THE INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR OPERATION ARE ON HOLD UNTIL THE SHORING SYSTEM IS AVAILABLE AND CAN BE INSTALLED TO ALLOW SAFE ENTRANCE INTO THE EXCAVATION.    THIS LINE WAS ABANDONED FOLLOWING THE INVESTIGATION INTO REPAIRING THE PIPELINE. THE COST AND DIFFICULTY OF REPAIR WERE THE ATTRIBUTING FACTORS FOR THE DECISION.

VENTING OCCURRED ON TWO OCCASIONS: 1) AT 1840 HOURS ON 5/26/11 AND COMPLETED AT 0545 HOURS ON 5/27/11 AND 2) AT 1453 HOURS ON TUESDAY MAY 31 AND WAS COMPLETED LATER THE SAME DAY AT APPROXIMATELY 2200 HOURS.  GAS SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES WERE STANDING BY DURING THE VENTING, PURGING AND RE-PRESSURIZATION ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER NO CUSTOMER CALLS WHERE RECEIVED.  THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF GAS VENTED IS 465 MMCF.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES.  THERE WERE NO MAJOR MEDIA OR PUBLIC AGENCIES PRESENT. THIS INCIDENT IS REPORTABLE DUE TO DAMAGES EXCEEDING $50,000. ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2014, PG&E DETERMINED THAT THE VOLUME OF GAS INTENTIONALLY RELEASE SHOULD BE CORRECTED TO 465 MMCF AND THE COST OF GAS INTENTIONALLY RELEASED SHOULD BE CORRECTED TO $2,000,000.

THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ON SITE AND HAD CLOSED A ROAD ADJACENT TO THE STATION.  COMPANY EMPLOYEES HAD ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 16:00 AND CONFIRMED THAT UNIT #3 WAS ON FIRE.  BY 16:35 THE STATION WAS SHUT IN AND THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED.    AFTER A THOROUGH EXAMINATION, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT ONLY UNIT #3 HAD BEEN DAMAGED.  IT WAS DECLARED TO BE UNAVAILABLE FOR SERVICE, PENDING FURTHER ASSESSMENT AND REPAIR.  THE OTHER UNITS WERE LATER RETURNED TO SERVICE WITHOUT INCIDENT.    THE UNITS AT THIS STATION ARE OWNED BY EXTERRAN AND LEASED TO COLUMBIA.  A REPRESENTATIVE OF EXTERRAN ARRIVED AT THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 18:45 AND PROVIDED AN INITIAL DAMAGE ESTIMATE OF $125,000 TO $250,000.  THIS ESTIMATE WAS RECEIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 19:02.  UPON RECEIPT OF THIS ESTIMATE, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED.  THE NRC AND PHMSA SOUTHERN REGION OFFICES WERE NOTIFIED AT 19:44 AND 20:08 RESPECTIVELY.     OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE DAYS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE EVENT WERE ESTABLISHED.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE COMPRESSOR CROSSHEAD SLIDE HAD FAILED AND SIEZED ON UNIT #3.  THE RESULTANT HEAT AND DAMAGE IGNITED CRANKCASE OIL VAPORS (VIA THE OIL BREATHER) AND A NEARBY LUBE OIL DAY STORAGE TANK.  THE HEAT FROM THE OIL FIRE HAD, IN TURN, DAMAGED A VALVE IN THE STARTING GAS SYSTEM, CAUSING GAS LEAKAGE AND A SUBSEQUENT SMALL SECONDARY FIRE.

ON THE MORNING OF MAY 12, A SLOW PRESSURE DROP WAS NOTED ON LINE B NEAR COLUMBIA GAS TRANSMISSION'S WALBRIDGE COMPRESSOR STATION.  THE CONTROLLER ON DUTY CONTACTED THE LOCAL TEAM LEADER, WHO THOUGHT THAT ONE OR MORE PRODUCERS IN THE AREA UPSTREAM OF THE PRESSURE DEVICE MIGHT BE MAKING AN OPERATIONAL CHANGE.  A DECISION WAS MADE TO MONITOR THE PRESSURE FOR A SHORT WHILE.    THE PRESSURE CONTINUED TO SLOWLY DROP.  IT WAS DECIDED TO HAVE FIELD OPERATIONS START CHECKING THE LINE.  BY SHORTLY AFTER 3:30 A.M., LOCAL FIELD EMPLOYEES WERE BEING CONTACTED.  THEY BEGAN CHECKING LINE B AND OTHER UPSTREAM LINES THAT FEED INTO LINE B BETWEEN 4:30 AND 5:00 A.M.    THE AREA TRAVERSED BY LINE B AND ITS UPSTREAM FEEDER LINES IS REMOTE AND RUGGED, OFTEN WITH MILES BETWEEN ROAD ACCESS POINTS.  CHECKING THE SYSTEM WAS DIFFICULT AND SLOW.  AT A FEW MINUTES AFTER 9:00, A CREW CHECKING UPSTREAM FEEDER LINE P CAME UPON A LANDSLIDE AREA.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT GAS WAS ESCAPING FROM THE COUPLED LINE IN THIS AREA.  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS PART OF EASTERN KENTUCKY HAD EXPERIENCED AN UNUSUALLY WET SPRING.  THIS IS THOUGHT TO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE LANDSLIDE.    THE SITUATION WAS CALLED IN TO THE CONTROL ROOM.  QUESTIONS WERE ASKED, INVESTIGATED, AND ANSWERED TO OBTAIN ACCURATE INFORMATION.  AS SOON AS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION WAS OBTAINED TO DETERMINE THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURED, A CALL WAS MADE TO THE NRC AND PHMSA'S SOUTHERN REGION OFFICE.    MATERIALS AND EQUIPMENT WERE ASSEMBLED OVER THE NEXT DAY, AND RESTORATION WORK WAS BEGUN ON MAY 14.  THE LINE WAS READIED FOR PLACEMENT IN SERVICE BY 9:00 MAY 20, AND WAS FULLY RESTORED TO SERVICE BY 12:05 A.M. ON MAY 21.    NOTE THAT THE GAS LOSS CALCULATIONS REFLECT OUR BEST RECONSTRUCTION OF THE EVENTS AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE CONDITION.  HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT GAS LOSS VOLUME MAY HAVE EXCEEDED 3,000 MCF THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE INCIDENT."

A FAILURE ANALYSIS AND METALURGICAL STUDY WAS COMPLETED ON THE FAILED GIRTH WELD.  THE REPORT INDICATES THE  LEAKAGE WAS DUE TO LACK OF FUSION IN THE WELD AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION ON THE GIRTH WELD AND WIDE WELD GAP DUE TO MISALIGNMENT. IN ADDITION TO THE WIDE ROOT GAP, THE USE OF ONLY TWO FILL PASSES IN THE AREA OF THE LEAKAGE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE LACK OF FUSION AND RESULTING LEAK."

MR. POTTER INDICATED THAT THERE WAS DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE AND THAT GAS WAS VENTING TO ATMOSPHERE. THE LOCATION OF THE DAMAGED PIPELINE IS THE TRACY BRANCH LINE AT APPROXIMATE MILEPOST 0.20. THE LEGAL DESCRIPTION IS SECTION NW1/2 17, TOWNSHIP 109N, RANGE 34W ALL IN BROWN COUNTY, MINNESOTA APPROXIMATELY 1/2 MILE NORTH OF U.S. HIGHWAY 14 AND 1/8 MILE EAST OF COUNTY ROAD 5.  NORTHERN IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED EMPLOYEES TO THE SITE AND UPON ARRIVAL THEY CONFIRMED THAT IT WAS NORTHERN'S TRACY, MN (MNB65201) 6-INCH BRANCH LINE THAT HAD BEEN HIT. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO EXPLOSION, NO INJURIES AND NO EVACUATIONS. A GAS DETECTOR WAS UTILIZED TO CHECK THE AREA AND A 20% LEL READING WAS INDICATED APPROXIMATELY 50 YARDS DOWNWIND. A PIR OF 109 FEET WAS ESTABLISH AS A SAFE ZONE RADIUS AROUND THE INCIDENT SITE. THE TRACY BRANCH LINE PROVIDES GAS SERVICE TO THE TOWNS OF SANBORN, WALNUT GROVE, REVERE AND TRACY, MINNESOTA AND THE HIGHWATER ETHANOL PLANT.  BOTTLE TRUCKS WERE BROUGHT IN FROM WATERLOO, IA, FARMINGTON, MN, SOUTH SIOUX CITY, IA, OGDEN, IA AND NORTH BRANCH, MN AS BACKUPS TO SUPPLY GAS TO THE TOWNS DURING THE REPAIR PROCESS. A STOPPLE BYPASS HAD TO BE INSTALLED TO MAINTAIN SERVICE TO THE HIGHWATER ETHANOL PLANT DURING THE PIPELINE REPAIRS. APPROXIMATELY 31 FEET OF 6-INCH NOMINAL DIAMETER PIPE WAS REPLACED WITH NEW 6-INCH, 0.280 WALL THICKNESS, ERW, GRADE X42 TESTED PIPE WITH FBE COATING. ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT:  THE LANDOWNER HAD MADE A ONE CALL, HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THE DESCRIPTION OF THE WORK AREA DID NOT COVER THE  AREA OF HIS PROPERTY THAT THE PIPELINE CROSSED, THEREFORE NORTHERN DID NOT RECEIVE NOTIFICATION OF A ONE CALL REQUEST TO LOCATE AND MARK THE PIPELINE ON THE PROPERTY. THERE WAS REQUIRED PERMANENT LINE MARKERS IN THE FENCE LINES INDICATING THE PRESENCE OF A PIPELINE ON THE PROPERTY. THIS IS BEING INVESTIGATED FURTHER BY NORTHERN WITH THE LANDOWNER/CONTRACTOR AND THE ONE CALL CENTER. FILING OF AN INCIDENT REPORT WAS REQUIRED AS THE COST TO COMPLETE REPAIRS EXCEEDED THE $50,000.00 REPORTING THRESHOLD. A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN ALL FINAL COST OF REPAIRS IS CALCULATED.   SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT:  REVISED COST INCURRED IN PART D, SECTION 7 AS A FINAL ESTIMATED OF ALL COST HAVE BEEN CALCULATED BY NORTHERN. NO FURTHER ACTIONS ARE REQUIRED OR PLANNED OTHER THAN FOLLOW UP BY NORTHERN'S LEGAL DEPARTMENT.  THIS FINAL REPORT IS SUBMITTED TO CLOSE OUT THE ORIGINAL REPORT NO. 20110050 -15237 DATED 05/12/2011.  SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT FILED ON ORIGINAL REPORT # 20110050-15237 DTD 05/12/2011 AND PREVIOUS SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT #20110050-15284 TO UPDATE AREAS FROM DISCUSSION WITH MNOPS REPRESENTATIVES REVIEW I.E., UPDATED A7, FILLED IN 19A AND 19B THAT DID NOT CARRY OVER FROM ORIGINAL REPORT, ATTEMPTED TO PUT UNKNOW IN YEAR OF MANUFACTURE BUT FORM WOULD NOT ALLOW, REVISED PIR TO 117 FEET BASED ON 796 MAOP, LENGTH OF 400 FEET OF PIPE ISOLATED WAS DISTANCE BETWEEN STOPPLE VALVES (FORM WOULD NOT ALLOW ADDITIONAL DESCRIPTION). ATTEMPTED TO  RESPOND TO G3, LINE 16 REGARDING DID THE DAMAGE CAUSE AN INTERRUPTION IN SERVICE WITH NO, HOWEVER THE FORM SHOWED NUMBERS 15 AND 17 BUT DID NOT LIST ITEM 16.

THE MONTH PRECEDING THE INCIDENT EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY HIGH QUANTITIES OF RAINFALL. THE RESULTING WATER TABLE WAS HIGH ENOUGH TO PRODUCE UPWARD BUOYANT FORCES ON THE PIPE, WHILE THE PROBABLE SATURATION OF THE SOIL COVER REDUCED ITS BREAKOUT RESISTANCE. THE COMBINATION OF BUOYANT FORCES AND UPWARD THRUST FORCES PRODUCED BY AN APPARENT SMALL ANGULAR MISALIGNMENT AT THE SEPARATED COUPLING EXCEEDED THE UPTHRUST RESISTANCE OF THE SOIL.    **THIS REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO PHMSA'S REQUEST, (DOCKET ID PHMSA-2013-0028), FOR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS FROM OPERATORS WHO SUBMITTED REPORTS FOR INCIDENTS OCCURRING AFTER JANUARY 1, 2010, WITH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:  (1) ``PIPE GIRTH WELD'' WAS SELECTED AS THE ``ITEM INVOLVED IN INCIDENT'' IN PART C3 OF THE REPORT.

ON 2/19/2011 AT 01:30 CREWS BEGAN BLOWING DOWN AND THE PRESSURE WAS LOWERED TO 400# BY 03:30.  PERSONNEL STAYED AT EACH MLV LOCATION MONITORING PRESSURES (12 HOUR ROTATION FOR DURATION OF INCIDENT).    ON 2/21/2011 AT 11:00 EXCAVATION BEGAN TO INSTALL A STOPPLE FITTING 3.5 MILES NORTH OF THE LEAK.      ON 2/22/2011 AT 11:00 THE STOPPALL WAS COMPLETED AND CEGT TEAM PERSONNEL BLEW DOWN A 6.6 MILE PIPELINE SECTION CONTAINING THE LEAK.  AT 15:00 THE LEAK WAS EXPOSED ENOUGH TO DETERMINE A CAUSE, APPROXIMATELY A  4"" CRACK IN THE PIPE.      ON 2/23/2011 AT 16:30 PIPE WAS DELIVERED AND WELD CAPS WERE INSTALLED.  AT 19:00 A 4 HOUR HYDRO TEST BEGAN, IT ENDED NEAR 24:00.      ON 2/24/2011 AT 07:00 CONTRACTORS BEGAN TO REMOVE THE PIPE TO BE REPLACED.  AT 10:00 THE CREW BEGAN INSTALLING THE NEW SECTION OF PIPE.    ON 2/25/2011 CREWS COMPLETED THE REPLACEMENT AND AT 17:00 BEGAN PURGING.  THE PURGE WAS COMPLETED AT 19:30.        ON 2/26/2011 AT 07:30 THE CREW BEGAN BACKFILLING AT LEAK EXCAVATION, RECOATING AT STOPPLE FITTING LOCATION AND THEN RELOADED THE LINE.  AT 16:00 THE SYSTEM WAS RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATIONS.      THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED WAS SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS.  IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FINAL FAILURE MODE WAS DUCTILE OVERLOAD OF THE REMAINING LIGAMENT BENEATH THE SCC.  THE REMAINING LIGAMENT WAS OBSERVED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS MINIMUM.  THE FACT THAT THESE CRACKS WERE CRITICAL AT THIS SIZE INDICATES THE PRESENCE OF A RELATIVELY HIGH AXIAL LOAD.  THE FINDINGS ARE AS FOLLOWS:"

SUBSEQUENTLY AFTER AN ELBOW RUPTURED THE RELEASED GAS IGNITED AND BURNED UNTIL GAS FLOW WAS STOPPED. THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS DETERMENED TO BE THE FAILURE OF A CHECK VALVE IN THE TURBINE UNIT DISCHARGE LINE.  1)  CHECK VAVLE ON TURBINE UNIT T7 DISCHARGE LINE WAS DAMAGED.  CHECK VALVE INTERNALS SEPERATED WHEN CENTER BOLT FAILED. FAILURE CAUSE WAS DETERMINED TO BE OVERTORQUING OF CENTER BOLT BY MANUFUCTURE DURING VALVE ASSEMBLY.  2)  DICCHARGE VALVE ON UNIT T7 DID NOT FULLY CLOSE DURING THE UNIT SHUT DOWN BECAUSE PARTS OF THE CHECK VALVE INTERNALS WAS STUCK IN THE VAVLE.   3)  24"" ELBOW LOCATED IN THE BASEMENT ON THE SUCTION LINE OF UNIT T7 COMPRESSOR, RUPTURED FROM A MANUFACTURING DEFECT WHICH WAS WEAKENED BY THE HEAT FROM THE LUBE OIL FIRE ALOWING GAS TO BE RELEASED INTO THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING AND IGNITE.

SYSTEM CONTROL NOTIFIED AN AREA PIPELINE TECHNICIAN.  AT 12:39 THE TECHNICIAN CONTACTED THE THIRD PARTY THAT REPORTED THE LEAK TO GET FURTHER DETAILS.  AT 12:45 HE THEN CONTACTED TWO ADDITIONAL TECHNICIANS TO ASSIST IN INVESTIGATING THE LEAK.  THEY ARRIVED AT THE LEAK SITE AT 13:24 AND MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THERE WAS A LEAK ON ML-2.  A TECHNICIAN AT THE SCENE CALLED SYSTEM CONTROL TO CONFIRM THE LEAK AT 13:38.  AT 13:40 TECHNICIANS ON LOCATION CONTACTED TECHNICIANS NEAR MILE POST 23 AND HAD THEM GO TO THE VALVE TO AWAIT NOTIFICATION FROM SYSTEM CONTROL TO ISOLATE THE LEAK.  TECHNICIANS AT THE SITE OF THE LEAK SECURED THE AREA AND STOOD BY AWAITING INSTRUCTIONS FROM SYSTEM CONTROL.  AT 15:45 TECHNICIANS WERE INSTRUCTED TO SETUP VALVES TO CROSS OVER GAS FROM ML-2 TO ML-3 AND THEN CLOSE THE VALVE AT MILE POST 23.  AT 15:46 THE TECHNICIANS AT MILE POST 13 WAS INSTRUCTED TO PUT VALVES IN SEQUENCE TO CROSS OVER GAS FROM ML-2 TO ML-3 TO ISOLATE THE LEAK.  AT 16:15 THE TECHNICIANS REDUCED THE FLOW ON ML-3 TO PULL DOWN ML-2 PRESSURE AND THEN CLOSED THE VALVE AT MILE POST 13.  TECHNICIANS THEN BEGAN BLOWING DOWN ML-2 AT 17:24 PM.  AT 17:38 ALL VALVES WERE LOCKED AND TAGGED.  AT 18:25 THEY HAD THE PRESSURE DOWN AND REPAIR CONTRACTORS MADE THE CUT AND SPOOLED IN A JOINT OF PIPE.      ON JANUARY 27TH AT 2:40 WELD X-RAYS BEGAN.  THE X-RAYS RESULTS WERE GOOD AND SYSTEM CONTROL WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE REPAIR CREW WAS READY TO PURGE AND PACK.  SYSTEM CONTROL HAD ARRANGED FOR ALTERNATIVE GAS SUPPLIES AND ADVISED THE REPAIR CREW TO HOLD OFF ON THE PURGE UNTIL 6:30.  THE CREW RETURNED TO THE REPAIR SITE AT 6:15 AND AT 6:34 BEGAN THE PURGE.  THE PURGE WAS COMPLETED AT 7:04 AND THE PACK BEGAN AT 7:05.  THE PIPELINE EQUALIZED AT 8:19 AT 600#.  ALL VALVES WERE PUT BACK IN THE NORMAL OPERATING POSITIONS AND CONTROL OF THE PIPELINE WAS TURNED OVER TO SYSTEM CONTROL AT 8:40.    THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED WAS SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE CONCLUSION IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE LEAK WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PREVIOUS MECHANICAL DAMAGE.  THE LEAK ORIGINATED AT A CRACK MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 5 1/2 INCHES LONG LOCATED WITHIN A 9-INCH LONG GOUGE.  THE GOUGE WAS ORIENTED AT APPROXIMATELY 45 DEGREES TO THE AXIS OF THE PIPE.  THE DENT OR DEFORMATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE GOUGE WAS MINOR, MEASURING LESS THAN 1% OF THE PIPE OD.  THE CRACK LIKELY GREW THROUGH THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS BY FATIGUE IN RESPONSE TO PRESSURE-CYCLE INDUCED FATIGUE. THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE PIPE SPECIMEN MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF API SPECIFICATION 5LX APPROPRIATE TO THE PIPE VINTAGE AND GRADE."

THE FIRE CONSUMED THE GAS FROM THE RELEASE (ESTIMATED TIME WAS SEVERAL MINUTES), AND THEN SOME FLAMMABLE MATERIAL (PRIMARILY INSULATION) CONTINUED TO BURN FOR SOME TIME. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO THE JT FACILITY (BOTH TRAINS), AND THE ENTIRE STORAGE FACILITY CEASED OPERATION.    SUPPLEMENTAL NARRATIVE:  AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS RELEASE WAS CORROSION OF THE ALUMINUM FINS OR PLATES OF THE GAS/GAS EXCHANGER DUE TO AQUEOUS CHLORIDES OR ACIDIC COMPOUNDS IN THE GLYCOL STREAM, RESULTING IN THE FAILURE OF THE EXCHANGER.    THE CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN TO ENSURE SAFE OPERATION OF THE JT PLANT IN THE FUTURE ARE:  - THE ALUMINUM PLATE FIN WILL BE REPLACED WITH A CARBON STEEL SHELL AND TUBE EXCHANGER AS THE GAS/GAS EXCHANGER.   THE SHELL AND TUBE EXCHANGERS ARE MUCH LESS PRONE TO CATASTROPHIC CORROSION ISSUES DUE TO THE METALLURGY AND PHYSICAL DESIGN OF THE SHELL AND TUBE.  THE SHELL AND TUBE EXCHANGER HAS A HEAD THAT CAN BE EASILY REMOVED FOR INSPECTION OR CLEANING.  - A NEW INLET FILTER COALESCER WILL BE USED TO REMOVE MORE OF THE PARTICULATE MATTER AND CHLORIDES IN THE INLET GAS.  THE FILTER IS A FULL-FLOW FILTER, HANDLING THE ENTIRE STREAM UPSTREAM OF THE GAS/GAS EXCHANGER.    - THE GLYCOL WILL ALSO BE TESTED ON A MORE FREQUENT BASIS THAN PREVIOUSLY.  THE ANALYSIS WILL CHECK FOR CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION, IRON, SULFUR, CALCIUM, PH, GLYCOL STRENGTH AND OTHER CONTAMINANTS IN GLYCOL.      IN ADDITION, THE ENTIRE JT PLANT OPERATION HAS BEEN MOVED TO A SAFER LOCATION AND ALL EXISTING EQUIPMENT WAS VISUALLY INSPECTED INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY AND WAS DEEMED SAFE TO PUT BACK INTO OPERATION.   THE ENTIRE GLYCOL REGENERATION SYSTEM WAS ALSO INSPECTED AND CLEANED."

AT 17:35 CEGT SYSTEM CONTROL DISPATCHED A CEGT FIELD TECHNICIAN TO INVESTIGATE AND VERIFY THE LEAK.  AT 20:05 CEGT TECHNICIANS REPORTED TO SYSTEM CONTROL THAT THE LEAK IS JUST OFF A DIRT ROAD WITH TWO ENTRANCES.  THE LEAK IS IN THE WOODS WITH NO STRUCTURES IN THE AREA OR, BUT GAS WAS BLOWING ACROSS THE ROAD.  IT WAS STILL NOT DETERMINED IF THE LEAK BELONG TO CEGT AND SINCE IT WAS DARK IT WAS DECIDED TO MONITOR THE LOCATION OVER NIGHT.  AT 20:50 CEGT TECHNICIANS REPORTED TO SYSTEM CONTROL THAT BOTH ENTRANCES TO THE DIRT ROAD LEADING INTO THE LEAK ARE BLOCKED OFF AND WILL BE MANNED OVER NIGHT.  ON 01/12/2011AT 07:53 SYSTEM CONTROL AND OPERATIONS HELD A CALL TO PLAN THE STEPS NEEDED TO DETERMINE IF THE LEAK WAS ON A CEGT PIPELINE.  AT 10:15 SYSTEM CONTROL NOTIFIED NRC OF THE LEAK AND INDICATED CEGT WAS IN THE PROCESS OF DETERMINING IF THE LEAK WAS ON CEGT'S PIPELINE.  AT 10:45 VALVES WERE SHUT ISOLATING THE PIPELINE SEGMENT WITH THE POSSIBLE LEAK AND IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE LEAK WAS ON CEGT'S SYSTEM.  VALVES WERE OPENED BACK UP, BUT THE PRESSURE WAS REDUCED FROM 300 LB. TO 250 LB.  DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT LOAD IN SHREVEPORT AND THE SURROUNDING AREA, LOWERING THE PRESSURE WAS THE CHOSEN COURSE OF ACTION UNTIL NOTIFYING CUSTOMERS OF THE NEED TO REDUCE THEIR TAKES.  CEGT CONTACTED THE LARGE INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS IN THE AREA TO REQUEST THEY REDUCE THEIR TAKES AND TO NOTIFY THEM THAT THEY MAY SEE LOWER PRESSURES BEGINNING AT 13:00.  AT 16:00 THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN FROM 250# TO ZERO. A 26 FOOT SECTION OF THE PIPELINE WAS REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH TESTED EMERGENCY PIPE.  AT 21:00 X-RAYS WERE COMPLETE THE LINE WAS PURGED AND PACKED.  CONTROL OF THE PIPELINE WAS GIVEN BACK TO SYSTEM CONTROL AT 22:15.       THE SECTION OF PIPE REMOVED THAT WAS REMOVED AND SENT TO KIEFNER & ASSOCIATES FOR METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS. THE CONCLUSION IS AS FOLLOWS:  THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY A BUCKLE THAT FORMED IN THE PIPE WALL FROM COMPRESSIVE AXIAL OR BENDING STRESS ON THE PIPELINE.  IT IS NOT KNOWN WHEN OR HOW THE BUCKLE WAS FORMED.  THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY AXIAL TENSILE STRESS ACTING ON THE BUCKLED PIPE WHICH RESULTED IN A CIRCUMFERENTIALLY ORIENTED FRACTURE IN THE BOTTOM QUADRANT OF THE PIPE THAT EXTENDED FROM THE 3 TO 9 OCLOCK PIPE POSITIONS.  BECAUSE THE FRACTURE PROPAGATED AFTER PENETRATING THE PIPE WALL, IT IS CLASSIFIED AS A RUPTURE RATHER THAN A LEAK, EVEN THOUGH THE PIPELINE WAS NOT COMPLETELY SEPARATED.  THE BUCKLE WAS POSITIONED IN AN AREA OF REDUCED WALL THICKNESS NEAR THE END OF A JOINT OF PIPE A FEW INCHES AWAY FROM A GIRTH WELD.  THE GIRTH WELD ITSELF WAS NOT INVOLVED IN THE FAILURE.  THE CURVATURE STRAIN WITH THE BUCKLES PROFILE WAS DETERMINED TO BE 9 PERCENT USING THE TEMPLATE OVERLAY METHOD , WHICH EXCEEDS THE 6 PERCENT STRAIN SAFE LIMIT.  THE PIPE JOINT WHICH CONTAINED THE FAILURE MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPROPRIATE EDITION OF API 5L.  NO OTHER DEFECTS WERE PRESENT NEAR THE FAILURE ORIGIN.  LAB ANALYSIS CONCLUDE THAT THE PIPE JOINT SPECIMEN CONTAINING THE FAILURE MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE APPROPRIATE EDITION OF API 5L.  TENSILE TEST RESULTS SHOWED A YIELD STRENGTH OF 41.800 PSI/API 5L REQUIREMENTS OF 30,0000 MINIMUM.  API STD 5L, TENTH EDITION, AUGUST 1944 FOR LAP-WELDED, BESSEMER LINE PIPE."

THE TRENCHER STRIKE RESULTED IN TWO HOLES ON THE SIDE OF THE EIGHT INCH WBI PIPELINE RELEASING GAS THAT WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 626 PSIG.  THE GAS IGNITED AND BURNED THE TRENCHER AND TWO PICKUPS PARKED NEARBY.  NO MAJOR INJURIES OR DEATHS OCCURRED.

QUAIN CALLED THE CONTRACTOR CONTACT AT THAT TIME AND INFORMED HIM OF THE CROSSING AND THAT WBI WILL NEED TO BE AT THE LOCATION PRIOR TO CROSSING TO EXPOSE WBI'S PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR INFORMED QUAIN THAT THEY WOULD BE AT THE LOCATION AT THE END OF THAT WEEK AND HE WOULD CALL QUAIN BACK WHEN THEY WERE THERE.  THE CONTRACTOR DID NOT CALL QUAIN BACK THAT WEEK AND THE END OF THE FOLLOWING WEEK IS WHEN THE CONTRACTOR HIT WBI'S LINE.  THE CONTRACTOR ADMITTED THAT HE FORGOT TO CALL BACK.  THE CONTRACTOR ALSO STATED THAT HE DID NOT REMEMBER SEEING THE WBI FLAGS AT THE SITE.  AFTER THE GAS WAS BLOWN DOWN AND SITE WAS DETERMINED TO BE SAFE, WBI PERSONNEL INVESTIGATED THE LOCATION.  IT WAS NOTED THAT THE CONTRACTOR HAD BLADED THE ROW PRIOR TO EXCAVATING TO REMOVE SNOW WHICH WOULD LIKELY DESTROY THE MARKER FLAGS ON THE ROW.  ONE CHARRED MARKER FLAG STILL REMAINED ON THE BLADED ROW BUT WAS FLAT ON THE GROUND.  TWO MARKER FLAGS WERE FOUND INTACT ADJACENT TO THE BLADED ROW.

UPON INITIAL INVESTIGATION, TGP OPERATIONS PERSONNEL FOUND A NATURAL GAS LEAK IN THE 100-2 PIPELINE.  VISUAL EXAMINATION REVEALED THAT THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM A CRACK IN A WRINKLE BEND.  THE CRACK WAS 1/2"" WIDE AND PROPAGATED FOR A LENGTH OF 50.5"" AROUND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE PIPELINE.  METALLUGICAL ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE CRACK IN THE WRINKLE BEND WAS LIKELY DUE TO CONCENTRATED MECHANICAL STRESSES COMING FROM EXTERNAL STRESSES FROM PROBABLE SHIFTING OF THE SURROUNDING SOIL, TRIAXIAL STATE OF STRESSES INHERENT TO IN-SERVICE WRINKLE BENDS (GEOMETRIC), AND INTERNAL LINE PRESSURE FROM NORMAL PIPELINE OPERATIONS."

AND RACE ST. MRT'S SYSTEM CONTROLLER NOTIFIED FIELD PERSONNEL AND OUR FIRST RESPONDERS ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 0650. THERE WAS A WATER LEAK AT THIS SITE ALSO AND WE COULD NOT IMMEDIATELY CONFIRM THAT IT WAS A GAS LEAK. WE CLOSED THE INLET BLOCK VALVE (BV42311 AT STATION 00+01) AT 0725 ON LINE A-122. THE DOWNSTREAM BLOCK VALVE (BV42312 AT STATION 175+92) WAS CLOSED AT 0755 ON LINE A-122. WE MONITORED THE LINE PRESSURE AND CONFIRMED THAT WE WERE LEAKING GAS AT 0837 ON OUR PIPELINE.  MRT'S CONTRACTOR BROUGHT IN A 6"" WATER PUMP TO REMOVE THE WATER AT 0930 SO WE COULD EXCAVATE THE AREA OF THE LEAK. THE WATER COMPANY WAS CALLED TO THE SCENE AND THEY DENIED THAT THEY HAD A LEAK. THERE WAS ALSO A LIFT STATION DRAINAGE LINE IN THIS AREA. IT WAS SHUT OFF. AT 1630 AFTER NOT MAKING MUCH PROGRESS IN THE WATER REMOVAL, THE WATER COMPANY WAS CALLED AGAIN. THEY ARRIVED AT 1745 AND CONFIRMED THAT THEY DID HAVE A LEAK. THE WATER LINE WAS SHUTOFF AND EXCAVATION WAS STARTED ONCE THE WATER WAS REMOVED.   AT 2130 A 4 BOLT LEAK CLAMP WAS INSTALLED ON THE GAS LINE TO SEAL OFF THE LEAK CAUSED BY EROSION FROM THE WATER AND SANDY SOIL. POSITIVE PRESSURE WAS MAINTAINED ON THE PIPELINE TO PREVENT WATER FROM ENTERING THE PIPE. THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN TO PREPARE FOR REPAIRS AT A LATER DATE. THE WATER COMPANY FINISHED THEIR LEAK REPAIRS AT 0230 ON DECEMBER 1ST. WATER WAS CONTINUOUSLY PUMP FROM THE AREA UNTIL DECEMBER 3RD.  MRT'S CONTRACT WELDERS STARTED FABRICATING THE REPLACEMENT PIPE AND FITTINGS AT THE COLUMBIA MEASURING STATION ON DECEMBER 1ST. ON DECEMBER 2ND, THE PIPE AND FITTINGS WERE TRANSPORTED TO THE CONTRACTORS WELDING SHOP TO FINISH THE FABRICATION AND X-RAY. AT THE LEAK SITE THERE WAS MORE EXCAVATION DONE AND A 20 FT. SECTION OF PIPE WAS REMOVED. FOREMAN PLUGS WERE INSTALLED IN THE ENDS OF THE PIPE TO PREVENT ANYTHING FROM ENTERING THE PIPELINE. AN 8 HOUR HYDROTEST WAS PERFORMED ON THE NEW PIPE AND FITTING ON DECEMBER 3RD.    DECEMBER 4TH THE CONTRACTOR DUG OUT MORE DITCH AND STARTED TO MAKE THE WELDS ON THE REPLACEMENT PIPE AND FITTINGS. BOTH OF THE WELDS WERE X-RAYED AND PASSED THE X-RAY.   ON DECEMBER 5TH, FINISHED DIGGING OUT THE DOWNSTREAM END OF THE LINE IN ORDER TO FINISH THE TIE-INS. THE WELDS FROM THE PREVIOUS DAY WERE BLASTED AND RECOATED. LINE WAS TIED-IN AT 1100. AFTER PASSING THE X-RAY, THE LAST WELD WAS BLASTED AND RECOATED. THE LINE WAS PURGED, LOADED, AND PLACED BACK IN SERVICE AT 1330 ON DECEMBER 5TH."

THE FARMER NOTIFIED PG&E OF THE GAS INCIDENT AT APPROXIMATELY 1500 HOURS AND PG&E PERSONNEL WERE ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1600 HOURS.  IT WAS DECIDED TO ALLOW GAS TO CONTINUE ESCAPING AND CONTINUE SERVICE TO FOUR DOWNSTREAM CUSTOMERS UNTIL COMPRESSED NATURAL GAS (CNG) WAS BROUGHT IN AND CONNECTED TO THE PIPELINE.  A PRESSURE CONTROL FITTING WAS INSTALLED DOWNSTREAM OF THE LOCATION AND VALVE 19.17 WAS CLOSED TO ISOLATE THE SEGMENT.  ONCE THE TAP FOR THE CNG WAS IN PLACE, PG&E STOPPED THE FLOW OF GAS ON THE TRANSMISSION LINE AT APPROXIMATELY 0605 HOURS ON NOVEMBER 30, AND COMPLETED REPAIRS OF THE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE BY REPLACING A 3-FOOT SECTION.  PG&E COMPLETED REPAIRS AND PLACED THE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE BACK INTO OPERATION AT APPROXIMATELY 1230 HOURS ON NOVEMBER 30.    THERE WERE NO FATALITIES OR INJURIES AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT AND NO SERVICE INTERRUPTION.  THERE WERE NO PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICIALS OR MEDIA ON-SITE.  THE INCIDENT IS REPORTABLE TO THE CPUC AND DOT DUE TO PROPERTY DAMAGES, INCLUDING THE LOSS OF GAS, THAT EXCEED $82,000.      A USA TICKET WAS IN EFFECT (# S 0343708 AND 0343731) FOR THE TRIANGLE T RANCH WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AND PG&E HAD WORKED WITH THE LANDOWNER TO DELINEATE, POTHOLE AND PROVIDE A BOUNDARY OF RIPPING OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS.  THE CONTRACTOR PERFORMING THE RIPPING (DAVID PRICE) DID NOT OBTAIN HIS OWN USA TICKET. THE PIPELINE HAD BEEN MARKED BY PG&E AND A BOUNDARY TWENTY FEET ON EITHER SIDE OF THE PIPE HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE LANDOWNER.  THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT WAS THE FAILURE OF THE EXCAVATOR TO PROPERLY EXPOSE AND PROTECT PG&E FACILITIES.  THE EXCAVATOR KNEW THE LINE LOCATION BUT THOUGHT HE WAS CLEAR WHEN HE LOWERED HIS RIPPER AND STRUCK THE LINE."

PRAXAIR PLOTTED THE GPS LOCATIONS OF THE APPARENT LEAK AND OF PRAXAIR'S ONLY PIPELINE IN THE VICINITY IN BOTH GOOGLE EARTH AND IN PRAXAIR'S GIS.  BOTH PLOTS SHOWED THE LEAK TO BE ABOUT 1600 FEET FROM PRAXAIR'S PIPELINE.

DAVIS PETROLEUM REPORTED THAT THEIR PLATFORMS WERE BLOCKED IN AND  PRESSURE WAS HOLDING.  THEY ALSO REPORTED THAT THEIR GIS SHOWS AN ABANDONED GAS WELL NEAR THE GPS COORDINATES OF THE LEAK.  PRAXAIR ALSO FILED A REPORT WITH THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION.  THE COAST GUARD REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO OIL SHEEN IN THE VICINITY AND THAT THEY HAD NO FURTHER PLANS TO OBSERVE THE SITE.  PRAXAIR PERSONNEL TOOK A BOAT OUT TO   THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK, BUT WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE IT DUE TO ROUGH WATER CONDITIONS.  IN THE AFTERNOON, PRAXAIR PERSONNEL MADE ANOTHER FLIGHT OVER THE LEAK AREA WITH THE AERIAL SURVEYOR.  THE LEAK WAS EASY TO FIND AND STILL PRESENT.  11/17/2010  PRAXAIR MADE A SECOND TRIP TO THE LEAK SITE WITH A LARGER BOAT, BUT COULD NOT LOCATE THE LEAK.  AN AIRCRAFT WAS DISPATCHED TO GUIDE THE BOAT TO THE LEAK AREA.  ON ARRIVAL, THE LEAK AND PRAXAIR'S PIPELINE WERE PRECISELY MARKED WITH BUOYS.  THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE BUOYS WAS MEASURED AT 1600 FEET.  PRAXAIR'S PIPELINE IS UNDER THREE FEET OF COVER, AND THE WATER DEPTH IS ABOUT 7 - 8 FEET AT ITS CLOSEST POINT TO THE LEAK LOCATION.  PRAXAIR'S CONTROL ROOM STAFF CONTINUE TO REPORT NO OPERATIONAL OBSERVATIONS THAT WOULD INDICATE A LEAK ON ITS PIPELINE NEAR THE LEAK.

APPROXIMATELY 7-MILES OF 24"" TRANSMISSION PIPELINE WAS BLOWN-DOWN FOR THIS REPAIR OPERATION.  THE TAP VALVE WAS EXCAVATED AND FOUND TO BE UNDAMAGED BY THE VEHICLE IMPACT.  THE 1/2"" PIPE AND BLEED VALVE WERE REPLACED, AND THE PIPELINE WAS BROUGHT BACK INTO SERVICE.  THE COMPANY'S ABOVE GROUND APPURTENANCES WERE PROTECTED ON TWO SIDES BY AN ""L"" SHAPED PROTECTIVE BARRIER THAT WAS LOCATED BETWEEN THE VALVE AND THE NEARBY ROADWAYS (APPROXIMATELY 75' FROM CHAMBERLAYNE ROAD AND 40' FROM RICHFOOD ROAD).  IT IS ALSO NOTED THAT VIRGINIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION (VDOT) APPROVED GUARDRAILS EXIST ALONG THE ADJACENT ROADWAYS TO KEEP CARS FROM ACCIDENTLY ENTERING THE ROW NEAR THE VALVE SITE.

GAS SUPERVISION ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 16:15 TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE AND IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE METHODS TO CONTROL THE RELEASE OF GAS.    THE METHOD SELECTED TO CONTROL THE RELEASE OF GAS WAS TO UTILIZE A DOWNSTREAM VALVE AND A STOPPER FITTING TO MINIMIZE CUSTOMER IMPACT.  ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES WERE DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE TO INSTALL THE EIGHT INCH FITTING AND STOPPER.  AT APPROXIMATELY 6:00 A.M. ON SUNDAY, OCTOBER 3, 2010, THE STOPPER WAS INSTALLED AND THE DOWNSTREAM VALVE CLOSED AT THE MILTON STATION TO ISOLATE A 3,000' SECTION OF MAIN.

REPAIRS TO THE TRANSMISSION PIPELINE WERE COMPLETED AT 10:30 AND THE STOPPER REMOVED AT APPROXIMATELY 11:00.    THE APPARENT CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS FAILURE OF THE EXCAVATOR TO CONTACT THE ONE-CALL-SYSTEM FOR A LOCATE REQUEST.  THE EXCAVATOR WAS AWARE OF THE ILLINOIS DAMAGE PREVENTION LAWS AND THE REQUIREMENT TO CALL IN A LOCATE REQUEST PRIOR TO EXCAVATING.  PIPELINE MARKERS WERE VISIBLE AT BOTH ENDS OF THE FIELD AND A CALL TO 811 WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE RISK OF THIS TRANSMISSION PIPELINE DAMAGE.

THE COMPANY HAS INITIATED A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS (RCA) INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. THE COMPRESSOR MANUFACTURER ALONG WITH A FAILURE ANALYSIS INVESTIGATIVE EXPERT (CONSULTANT) CONDUCTED THEIR INVESTIGATIONS INTO THIS INCIDENT.     THE RCA REPORT IDENTIFIED THAT THE SOURCE OF IGNITION WAS ARC WELDING BEING PERFORMED ON THE EXHAUST FLANGE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING.  NATURAL GAS WAS PRESENT IN THE CRANKCASE VENT DUE TO A PACKING LEAK IN THE COMPRESSOR CYLINDERS OF UNIT #3. THE PACKING LEAK ON UNIT NO. 3 TRAVELED VIA A COMMON OIL DRAIN TO THE UNIT NO. 2 COMPRESSOR CYLINDER DISTANCE PIECES AND THUS INTO THE UNIT NO.2 CRANKCASE AND VENT. GAS MONITORING WAS PERFORMED USING A GAS DETECTOR AT THE VENTS, EXHAUST, STARTERS, AND SURROUNDING AREA PRIOR TO THE WELDING AND THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF A COMBUSTIBLE ATMOSPHERE.  IT APPEARS THAT THE GAS MONITOR WAS NOT EXPOSED TO THE COMBUSTIBLE MIXTURE LONG ENOUGH TO PROVIDE AN ALARM TO THE OPERATOR.  SHUTOFF VALVES ON THE COMMON OIL DRAIN LINE THAT SERVE TO ISOLATE EACH UNIT WERE LEFT OPEN AND WERE NOT INCLUDED AS PART OF THE LOCKOUT/TAGOUT (LOTO) PROCEDURE BEING USED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.    RECOMMENDATIONS WERE NOTED AND SHARED VIA A SAFETY ALERT BROADCAST THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE COMPANY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.  AMONG THESE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE:    MANDATORY INSPECTION OF ALL UNITS AND FACILITIES COMPANY-WIDE FOR SIMILAR COMMON VENT/PIPING SYSTEMS THAT WERE FOUND AT THE INCIDENT SITE.  ENGINEERING SHALL REVIEW INSPECTION RESULTS, DOCUMENTATION AND ASSURE THE NECESSARY FOLLOW-UP ACTIVITIES ARE PLANNED AND COMPLETED. REVIEW AND PERFORM MODIFICATIONS TO STATION ISOLATION LOCK-OUT/TAG-OUT PROCEDURES TO INCLUDE DRAIN AND VENT VALVES THAT ARE COMMON WITHIN A STATION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A COMBUSTIBLE MIXTURE.      WHEN PERFORMING ""HOT WORK"" ON A COMPRESSOR UNIT, CONSIDERATIONS SHALL BE MADE FOR EVACUATING GAS FROM ALL UNITS WITHIN THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING. IDEALLY, ANY WELDING, BURNING, OPEN FLAME OR GRINDING TASKS SHOULD BE PERFORMED IN SAFE AREAS OUTSIDE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE COMPRESSOR BUILDING. WHEN HOT WORK IS NECESSARY IN BUILDINGS WITH PRESSURIZED UNITS, IT IS CRITICAL TO ENSURE EQUIPMENT SPECIFIC ISOLATION AND LOTO PLANS ARE IN PLACE AND THAT HOT WORK PERMITS ARE EXECUTED TO ENSURE ABSENCE OF ANY FLAMMABLE/EXPLOSIVE ATMOSPHERE.  LOTO PLANS SHOULD BE CHALLENGED AND REVIEWED BY OPERATIONS, ENGINEERING AND CONTRACTORS PERFORMING THE WORK BEFORE BEGINNING ANY WORK ON COMPRESSION UNITS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PATHS FOR A FLAMMABLE/EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE TO OCCUR."

ONE INDIVIDUAL WAS DEAD AT THE SITE AND ONE WAS TRANSPORTED BY LIFE FLIGHT TO A HOSPITAL AND DIED SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE VEHICLE STRUCK AND DAMAGED HIGH-PRESSURE NATURAL GAS PIPING IN SEVERAL PLACES IN THE TOWN BORDER STATION. A 1/4-INCH DIAMETER PIPE FITTING, BETWEEN THE STATION INLET FILTER AND THE FILTER INLET GAUGE ISOLATION VALVE WAS BROKEN, CAUSING THE RELEASE OF HIGH PRESSURE GAS. THE STATION PIPING WAS ISOLATED AND BLOWN DOWN TO ZERO PRESSURE AND UPON CLOSER OBSERVATION IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE 7.5 MILE LONG, 6-INCH BRANCH LINE TO THE STATION NEEDED TO BE ISOLATED AND BLOWN DOWN IN ORDER TO ENSURE SAFETY FOR ALL PERSONNEL WHILE INSPECTING FOR DAMAGE AND REPAIRING PIPING WITHIN THE TOWN BORDER STATION. THERE WERE NO DEFECTS FOUND BUT THE 6-INCH DIAMETER IN-LINE INSPECTION TOOL RECEIVER INLET AND THE 4-INCH DIAMETER STATION INLET VALVES WERE FOUND TO BE DAMAGED. BOTH THE 6 AND 4-INCH VALVES WERE REPLACED AS WELL AS THREE FITTINGS AND VARIOUS SMALL LENGHTS OF PIPE TO FACILITIATE REPLACEMENT OF THE VALVES. THERE WAS NO FIRE, EXPLOSION OR EVACUATIONS BECAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. UPON COMPLETION OF REPAIRS THE BRANCH LINE AND THE TOWN BORDER STATION WERE PURGED, RE-PRESSURIZED WITH NATURAL GAS AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE ETHANOL PLANT. THE VEHICLE CRASH WAS INVESTIGATED BY THE IOWA STATE HIGHWAY PATROL AND LOCAL COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.

THE TESTING CONSISTED OF FOUR TEST SECTIONS RUNNING EAST TO WEST FROM THE BRAZOS RIVER (STA. 2950+00) TO 4.5 MILES WEST OF MLV2 (STA. 4560+00). EACH TEST SECTION WAS TESTED TO A MINIMUM OF 100% SMYS FOR ONE HOUR AND THEN A SUBSEQUENT LEAK TEST AT 90% SMYS FOR A MINIMUM OF 8 HRS WITHOUT PRESSURE LOSS. SECTION 1 AND 4 SUCCESSFULLY PASSED THEIR INITIAL TESTS, SECTION 2 HAD TWO FAILURES AND SECTION 3 HAD 3 FAILURES BEFORE ACHIEVING A SUCCESSFUL TEST.

AT 10:40 PM AN ENOGEX EMPLOYEE ARRIVED AT THE POWER STATION TO ASSESS THE SITUATION. THE EMPLOYEE WAS GREETED AT THE MAIN FACILITY ENTRANCE BY AN AEP INCIDENT COMMANDER. LOCAL EMERGENCY RESPONDERS FROM THE JENKS FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS  VOLUNTARILY EVACUATED 70 PEOPLE FROM NEARBY HOMES PRIOR TO THE ARRIVAL OF ENOGEX PERSONNEL.  AT 10:48 PM THE ENOGEX EMPLOYEE WAS ESCORTED TO THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD BY THE AEP INCIDENT COMMANDER. THE ENOGEX EMPLOYEE DISCOVERED NATURAL GAS RELIEVING TO ATMOSPHERE FROM TWO (2) 4 INCH BY 6 INCH PRESSURE SAFETY VALVES (PSV) AND TWO (2) 6 INCH BY 8 INCH PRESSURE SAFETY VALVES (PSV). UPON ENTERING THE GAS YARD, THE EMPLOYEE SMELLED AN ODOR OF MERCAPTAN AND HIS PERSONAL GAS MONITOR ALARM ACTIVATED, WHICH INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF A FLAMMABLE MIXTURE OF NATURAL GAS IN AIR. THE EMPLOYEE SAW THAT A 3/4 INCH PIPE NIPPLE, WHICH WAS A PORTION OF THE PRESSURE REGULATOR SENSING ASSEMBLY, HAD BROKEN RESULTING IN TWO (2) DEMAND REGULATORS TRAVELING TO THE FULLY OPEN POSITION, THUS INCREASING THE OPERATING PRESSURE DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATORS TO EQUAL THE 150 PSIG SET POINT OF THE FOUR (4) PSVS. AT 11:08 PM ENOGEX GAS CONTROL CLOSED AN AUTOMATED PIPELINE VALVE LOCATED UPSTREAM OF THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD TO ISOLATE THE GAS YARD FROM THE PIPELINE. NATURAL GAS CONTINUED TO ESCAPE TO ATMOSPHERE THROUGH A 3/4 INCH PIPE FITTING. AT 11:14 PM ENOGEX EMPLOYEES ISOLATED THE REGULATOR PIPING TO END THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS. THE NIPPLE WAS REPLACED AND THE PRIMARY GAS LOAD TO THE POWER STATION RESUMED AT 1:05 AM. AN INTERNAL INCIDENT INVESTIGATION WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE ROOT CAUSE AND CAUSAL FACTORS OF THE INCIDENT. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT A 3/4 INCH THREADED PIPE NIPPLE BROKE AT THE THREADED CONNECTION TO A 3/4 INCH THREAD-O-LET WELDED TO THE PIPING IMMEDIATELY DOWNSTREAM OF ONE OF THE REGULATORS. THE FAILURE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY EXCESSIVE VIBRATION AND/OR METAL FATIGUE. TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FINAL DEMAND PRESSURE TO THE CUSTOMER DURING A WIDE RANGE OF POWER STATION LOAD CONDITIONS, THE REGULATOR STATION DESIGN CONSISTS OF TWO REGULATORS, I.E. REGULATOR 1 AND REGULATOR 2, PLACED IN PARALLEL TO ONE ANOTHER. A SINGLE PNEUMATIC PRESSURE CONTROLLER PROVIDES THE NECESSARY LOADING PRESSURE TO EACH REGULATOR. A LOADING PRESSURE OF 3 TO 9 PSIG CONTROLS REGULATOR1 AND A LOADING PRESSURE OF 9 TO 15 PSIG CONTROLS REGULATOR 2. THE FAILURE OF THE PIPE NIPPLE IN THE PRESSURE SENSING LINE AND SUBSEQUENT LOSS OF PROCESS VARIABLE CAUSED REGULATOR 1 TO TRAVEL TO THE FULLY OPEN POSITION FOLLOWED BY REGULATOR 2. THIS CREATED AN INCREASE IN THE DOWNSTREAM FINAL DEMAND PRESSURE TO A PRESSURE EQUAL TO THE 150 PSIG SETPOINT OF FOUR PRESSURE SAFETY VALVES (PSVS) INSTALLED TO PROTECT THE DOWNSTREAM PIPING FROM ACCIDENTAL OVERPRESSURE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE RESULTING ACTION OF THE TWO REGULATORS, ALONG WITH THE ACTIVATION OF THE FOUR PSVS DOWNSTREAM OF THE REGULATORS RESULTED IN THE UNCONTROLLED GAS RELEASE TO ATMOSPHERE. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TIMELY RESPONSE BY ENOGEX PERSONNEL TO CONTROL THE GAS RELEASE WAS HINDERED BY THE FOLLOWING: 1)A MISCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN AEP PERSONNEL AND THE JENKS FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS.  THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL ARRIVED ON SCENE (AT MAIN GATE) WELL AHEAD OF ENOGEX PERSONNEL.  TO PREVENT THE EMERGENCY RESPONSE PERSONNEL FROM ENTERING THE FACILITY, AEP WOULD NOT OPEN THE MAIN GATE FOR ENOGEX AS QUICKLY AS DESIRED. 2) A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS CONDITION INSIDE THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD, WHEREAS THE PRESENCE OF A FLAMMABLE GAS MIXTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE PREVENTED ENTRY. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THE ENOGEX RESPONDER COULD NOT SAFELY ENTER THE LOW PRESSURE GAS YARD TO MANUALLY CLOSE ISOLATION VALVES.

THE FAILURE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRESS-CORROSION CRACKING (SCC). A COLONY OF SCC DEVELOPED ON THE EXTERNAL PIPE SURFACE BENEATH A LAP IN THE TAPE WRAP COATING THAT HAD DISBONDED. THE INTACT BUT DISBONDED COATING ALLOWED MOISTURE TO COME IN CONTACT WITH THE PIPE SURFACE AND THE HIGH DIELECTRIC STRENGTH OF THE TAPE COATING EFFECTIVELY SHIELDED THAT AREA OF THE PIPE SURFACE FROM CATHODIC PROTECTION. INDIVIDUAL SCC GREW IN LENGTH AND DEPTH COALESCED TO FORM ONE LARGE CRACK THAT EXCEEDED THE RESISTANCE OF THE MATERIAL AND CAUSED THE FAILURE.

NORTHERN EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NATURAL GAS BLOWING FROM NORTHERN'S MNM80104-M500D MAINLINE AT A VALVE SITE AT APPROXIMATE MILEPOST 95.89. PIPELINE PRESSURE ON THE LINE WAS 739 PSIG. THE LINE HAS AN MAOP OF 1,000 PSIG. A PIR OF 563 FEET WAS CALCULATED. LOCAL POLICE ASSISTED WITH BARRICADING OFF 320TH STREET WHICH PASSES BY THE VALVE SITE. THERE WAS NO FIRE, NO EXPLOSION AND NO INJURIES. AS A PRECAUTION 5 PEOPLE WERE EVACUATED FROM RESIDENCES IN THE NEAR AREA. APPROXIMATELY 13 MILES OF C LINE AND 6 MILES OF D LINE WERE SHUT IN TO ENABLE ISOLATION OF THE LINE SEGMENT. AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO DRAW GAS PRESSURE DOWN WITH COMPRESSION HORSEPOWER @ THE FARMINGTON COMPRESSOR STATION. AT 490 PSIG COMPRESSION WAS SHUT DOWN DUE TO HIGH ROD LOAD ON UNITS. AN EMERGENCY 1-CALL WAS MADE AND CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL WERE CALLED TO ASSIST WITH REPAIRS. IT WAS DETERMINE THAT LINE WOULD BE BLOWN DOWN TO 50 PSIG FOR OVERNIGHT, ONE PERSON WOULD MAN SITE THRU THE NIGHT. ON JUNE 24 THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN TO ZERO PRESSURE. FOUR FARMTAP CUSTOMERS WERE IMPACTED. EXCAVATION WAS COMMENCED AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT FROST BALL. A HOT WATER HYDRO VAC WAS UTILIZED TO REMOVE FROST. INVESTIGATION INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A PORTION OF THE FLANGE GASKET BLOWN OUT, WHICH ALLOWED GAS LEAKAGE. THE FLANGE WAS DISASSEMBLED AND A NEW LAMONS 30"" 600 ASME B16 47A, ASME B1620, 304IR GASKET WAS INSTALLED. THE FLANGE BOLTS WERE RE-INSTALLED AND RETORQUED. ADDITIONAL CONCRETE SUPPORT BLOCKS WERE INSTALLED AND ALLOWED TO CURE. ON JUNE 28TH THE LINE WAS PURGED AND SLOWLY RELOADED TO OPERATIONAL PRESSURE, LEAK CHECKED, COATED AND BACKFILLED. A SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT WILL BE FILED WHEN ALL COST OF REPAIRS IS CALCULATED. FINAL COST WERE CALCULATED AND INITIAL COSTS WERE CHANGED/UPDATED. ON APRIL18,2011 A SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT WAS FILED AS PHMSA REQUESTED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON PIPE SPEC'S, PART C, ITEM 3 OF THE REPORT AND COST OF GAS RELEASED UNINTENTIONALLY IN PART D, ITEM 7B. THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN ADDED TO THIS SUPPLEMENTAL FINAL REPORT AS REQUESTED. SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT - THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AS A SUPPLEMENTAL/FINAL REPORT TO  REPORT # 20100039-15215 DATED 08/31/2010 AS A FOLLOW UP TO DISCUSSION WITH PHMSA REPRESENTATIVES. PART A ITEM 7 WAS CHANGED TO MATCH TIME ON THE NRC FORM, THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT WAS CHANGED FROM EQUIPMENT FAILURE TO INCORRECT OPERATIONS. AN ANALYSIS OF THE EVENT INDICATES THAT THERE WAS ADEQUATE, PROPER SUPPORT FOR THE PIPING, NO INDICATION OF SUBSIDENCE AND ALTHOUGH THE GASKET MATERIAL WAS NOT ANALYZED DUE TO IT'S DAMAGED CONDITION, THERE ARE TWO OTHER SIMILAR 30-INCH VALVES WITH THE SAME TYPE OF GASKETS INSTALLED ON THIS PIPING AND NEITHER OF THOSE HAVE HAD ANY PROBLEMS OR LEAKS, THIS IS A VERY GOOD, HIGH QUALITY GASKET. THE LEAKAGE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN BETWEEN THE 6 O'CLOCK AND 9 O'CLOCK POSITION ONLY. NORTHERN BELIEVES THAT THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS EVENT IS MOST LIKELY THAT ALL OF THE BOLTS ON THE FLANGE WERE NOT CONSISTENTLY TORQUED WHICH LED TO LEAKAGE, WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE GASKET FAILURE. NORTHERN IS ISSUING A TECHNICAL BULLETIN TO ALL EMPLOYEES, INSPECTORS AND CONSTRUCTION PERSONNEL RE-EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF  PROPER TORQUEING AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF ENGINEERING STANDARD 7570 WHEN JOINING OF PIPE & PIPING COMPONENTS OTHER THAN BY WELDING. SHOULD THERE BE AN EVENT OF THIS NATURE IN THE FUTURE EVERY EFFORT WILL BE MADE TO ENSURE THAT EVEN THOUGH THE GASKET MATERIAL MAY BE DAMAGED IT WILL BE SENT TO A LABORATORY FOR ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE IF THE QUALITY OF THE GASKET WAS OR IS A FACTOR IN THE EVENT."

AFTER HAVING NOTIFIED GAS CONTROL IN HOUSTON, SEVERAL SOUTH TEXAS DISTRICT EMPLOYEES WERE CONTACTED AND REQUESTED THAT THEY CLOSE BOTH BLOCK VALVES 10-A-70 AND 10-A 80, WHICH WOULD ISOLATE THE SECTION OF PIPELINE WHERE THE LEAK WAS LOCATED. THE PIPELINE WAS ISOLATED AND HAD BEEN MADE SECURE BY 7:15 PM.    NRC WAS CONTACTED AT 7:37 PM AND ANY OTHER AGENCIES THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE INCLUDED IN THE NOTIFICATION PROCESS. THESE NOTIFICATIONS WERE COMPLETED BY 8:00 PM THAT EVENING..      A GAS HANDLING PLAN AND A WORK PLAN WERE GENERATED EARLY ON TUESDAY MORNING AND THE SECTION OF PIPELINE BETWEEN THE TWO BLOCK VALVE SETTINGS WAS BLOWN DOWN. A CONTRACTOR WAS DISPATCHED TO THE LOCATION AND ONCE THE PIPELINE WAS MADE SAFE, STARTED EXCAVATING THE LINE TO EXPOSE THE AREA OF THE LEAK. DURING THE EXCAVATION PROCESS, AN OLD AND MOSTLY CORRODED 2"" PIPELINE WHICH WAS ALREADY IN PIECES WAS UNCOVERED. THIS 2"" PIPELINE WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2"" ABOVE OUR 24"" PIPELINE.  THIS 2"" PIPE WAS ABANDONED AND BEEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR SOME TIME.  THE SOIL AROUND THE 2"" PIPELINE AND DOWN TO OUR PINHOLE LEAK WAS SATURATED WITH SOME TYPE OF PRODUCT THAT SMELLED VERY MUCH LIKE CONDENSATE. THE PINHOLE LEAK WAS LOCATED AND AFTER CLOSE INSPECTION, A 30' SECTION OF PIPE WAS CUT OUT AND REPLACED WITH NEW PRETESTED PIPE. THE ORIGINAL 24"" PIPE AT BOTH ENDS OF THE 30' SECTION WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION BOTH INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY. SOIL SAMPLES WERE TAKEN OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA AND WERE SHIPPED OVERNIGHT TO A LAB FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. WILLIAMS HAD A METALLURGICAL TEST OF THE PIPE THAT WAS CUT OUT IN ORDER THAT IT CAN IDENTIFY THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE CORROSION AT THAT PARTICULAR SITE.    THE 24"" PIPELINE WAS PURGED, PACKED AND PLACED BACK IN SERVICE AT 11:00 AM ON THURSDAY, APRIL 29TH, 2010.     METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT THE REASON FOR THE LEAS WAS MICROBIOLOGICAL ON 6/2/2010.  THE METALLURGICAL REPORT FOUND THE FOLLOWING;    THE COAL TAR CORROSION PROTECTION THAT COATED THE PIPELINE WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY INSTALLED HAD BEEN SEVERELY DEGRADED IN THE AREA AROUND THE LEAK, PROBABLY BY A CHEMICAL SUBSTANCE THAT HAD APPARENTLY LEAKED FROM THE 2-INCH PIPELINE INSTALLED OVER THE 24-INCH LINE.    VISUAL EXAMINATION OF THE LEAK SHOWED CORROSION PITTING ON THE OUTSIDE SURFACE.  SOME OF THE PITS HAD A FIBROUS APPEARANCE INDICATING PREFERENTIAL ATTACK FOLLOWING THE PIPE AXIS.  THE FIBROUS APPEARANCE WAS CHARACTERISTIC OF MICROBIOLOGICALLY-INFLUENCED CORROSION (MIC).    METALLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS OF THE CORROSION PITS SHOWED UNDERCUTTING AND PITS WITHIN PITS, WHICH ARE ALSO UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS OF MIC.    THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY MIC, WHICH OCCURED AFTER THE COAL TAR COATING HAD BEEN DEGRADED EXPOSING THE BARE PIPE.  THE PRESENCE OF SULFUR AND MOISTURE IN THE SOIL AROUND THE LEAK CREATED AN IDEAL ENVIRONMENT FOR MIC TO OCCUR."

A SHORT SECTION (APPROXIMATELY 12-18 INCHES) OF A 16 INCH RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM WAS TO BE REMOVED AND A 16 X 8 REDUCING TEE ADDED TO CONNECT A NEW RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM TO THE EXISTING RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM.  A LOCK-OUT/TAG-OUT PROCEDURE AND AN AIR MOVER WERE IN PLACE TO ELIMINATE OR MITIGATE HAZARDS DURING THE HOT WORK OPERATION.    MEANWHILE, WORKERS WERE INSTALLING A NEW METER TUBE ON AN ADJACENT PIPING MANIFOLD THAT WAS CONNECTED TO THE RECYCLE PIPING SYSTEM.    A 12"" BLIND FLANGE WAS REMOVED FROM THE PIPING MANIFOLD TO INSTALL AN ISOLATION VALVE BETWEEN THE NEW METER TUBE AND THE EXISTING PIPING MANIFOLD.  A CONTRACT EMPLOYEE WAS STANDING BESIDE THE OPEN ENDED PIPE FLANGE AT THE SAME TIME THE NEARBY HOT WORK IGNITED VAPORS INSIDE THE PIPING SYSTEM.  CONTRACT EMPLOYEE WAS INJURED AS A RESULT OF A FLASH FIRE WHICH IMMEDIATELY EXTINGUISHED ITSELF.  CONTRACT EMPLOYEE'S INJURIES REQUIRED IN-PATIENT HOSPITALIZATION.      UPDATE NOVEMBER 23, 2010  AN INVESTIGATION TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT AND AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OR CAUSES OF THE INCIDENT.  THE FOLLOWING CAUSAL FACTORS WERE IDENTIFIED:     1. TWO INDEPENDENT JOBS WERE ON-GOING AT THE SAME TIME WHICH IMPACTED ONE ANOTHER AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THESE JOBS  WAS NOT ADEQUATE TO CONSIDER THE IMPACT OF INDEPENDENT ACTIONS TAKEN.  2. THREE VALVES (XV #853, XV # 861, AND XV # 871) FAILED OPEN WHEN THE INSTRUMENT AIR BLED OFF FOLLOWING THE INITIAL ESD.  THIS CONDITION MAY HAVE UNKNOWINGLY INCREASED THE VOLUME OF VAPORS WITHIN THE PIPING REQUIRED TO BE PURGED PRIOR TO THE HOT WORK BEING CONDUCTED THEREBY DECREASING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AIR MOVER.    3. A12-INCH BLIND FLANGE WAS REMOVED, POTENTIALLY CHANGING THE AIR FLOW DYNAMICS WITHIN THE PIPE AND POSSIBLY LIMITING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AIR MOVER IN THE LOCATION OF THE 16-INCH TEE ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE EXISTING RECYCLE METER RUN.  4. THE SCOPE OF THE SAFE WORK PERMIT (WRITTEN PRIOR TO WORK BEING PERFORMED), WHICH INCLUDED MULTIPLE CONTRACTORS OVER AN ENTIRE SHIFT, WAS LIKELY TOO BROAD TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING MULTIPLE TASKS.    THE FOLLOWING ROOT CAUSE(S) WERE IDENTIFIED:    1. THE POTENTIAL HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE ONGOING AND SEEMINGLY UNRELATED JOBS WITHIN THE SAME GENERAL WORK AREA WERE NOT SUFFICIENTLY ANALYZED TO CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ONE JOB ON THE OTHER.  2. THREE VALVES THAT WERE CLOSED DURING LO/TO FAILED OPEN DUE TO THE LOSS OF INSTRUMENT GAS AFTER THE ESD.  THIS CONDITION WAS EITHER NOT ANTICIPATED OR NOT CONSIDERED TO BE RELEVANT DURING JOB PLANNING.  3. AN UNDETECTED FLAMMABLE ATMOSPHERE EXISTED WITHIN THE PIPING DURING AUTHORIZED HOT WORK ACTIVITIES.    RECOMMENDATIONS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS THE FINDINGS ABOVE TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE.  UPDATE MARCH 5, 2013: COMPLETED SECTION E.5.F."

PSNC ENERGY'S GAS CONTROL DISPATCHED COMPANY PERSONNEL TO THIS SITE TO INVESTIGATE THE ALARM NOTIFICATIONS.  ABOUT THE SAME TIME, RESIDENTS IN THE VICINITY OF THE MILL SPRING TAKE-OFF STATION REPORTED SEEING BRIGHT LIGHTNING AND IMMEDIATE THUNDER.     SIMULTANEOUS WITH THE SCADA ALARMS, AT APPROXIMATELY 6:40 P.M., A LOCAL PSNC ENERGY EMPLOYEE RECEIVED CALLS FROM THE POLK COUNTY SHERRIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND POLK COUNTY EMS INDICATING A FIRE AT THE MILL SPRING TAKE-OFF STATION.  THIS EMPLOYEE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED TO THE CALL AND ARRIVED AT THE MILL SPRING TAKE-OFF STATION AT 7:00 P.M.  THE PSNC ENERGY TAKE-OFF STATION WAS ON FIRE.    THE FIRE WAS OF A MAGNITUDE AND IN A LOCATION THAT THE PSNC ENERGY STATION VALVES COULD NOT BE REACHED.  PSNC ENERGY ENGINEERING AND OPERATIONS PERSONNEL DEVELOPED A PLAN TO ISOLATE THE TAKE-OFF STATION UTILIZING OTHER REMOTE PIPELINE BLOCK VALVES.  FIRE FIGHTERS USED WATER BLANKETS TO KEEP OTHER EQUIPMENT, SURROUNDING MATERIALS, AND VEGETATION FROM COMBUSTING.    AT 9:55 P.M. THE TAKE-OFF STATION WAS ISOLATED AND THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED.    BASED UPON THE LOCAL SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS AND FIRST-HAND ACCOUNTS, PSNC ENERGY'S SCADA SYSTEM ALARMS, AND POST-INCIDENT SITE EVALUATIONS, IT IS BELIEVED THAT LIGHTNING CAUSED A TUBING FAILURE WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY RESULTED IN A STATION FIRE."

THE ILI COMPANY NOTED DURING THE INITIAL EVALUATION OF THE DATA FROM THE ILI TOOL, THAT AN ANOMALY WAS DETECTED AND MAY HAVE A WALL LOSS GREATER THAN 70% OF THE WALL THICKNESS OF THE PIPE.  WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF NOTIFICATION TO TW, THE PIPELINE WAS REDUCED IN PRESSURE AND AN EXCAVATION CREW WAS SENT OUT TO THE SITE.  DURING THE BELL HOLE INVESTIGATION GAS DRIED SOIL WAS NOTED, SO THE EXCAVATION WAS TEMPORARILY STOPPED UNTIL A GAS DETECTOR HAD ""SNIFFED"" THE AREA FOR GAS.   THE GAS DETECTOR INDICATED A HIGH PPM OF METHANE GAS SO ALL CONSTRUCTION WAS STOPPED UNTIL THE PIPELINE WAS BLOWN DOWN TO ATMOSPHERE.  CONTINUED INVESTIGATION FOUND A PIN HOLE LEAK UNDER A THERMITE WELD THAT WAS PARTIALLY BONDED TO THE PIPE.  THE THERMITE WELD CONNECTED BOTH THE NEGATIVE HEADER CABLE THAT GOES TO THE RECTIFIER AND THE TEST LEAD WIRE THAT GOES TO THE CP TEST STAND.  THE THERMITE WELD WAS EASILY REMOVED WITH JUST A SMALL PULL ON THE WIRING.  THE NEGATIVE HEADER CABLE LEAD WAS A TRIANGLE PWC, INC S N-A 1-AWG TYPE THHN/THWN, GASOLINE AND OIL RESISTANT WIRE.  THE INSULATION ON THE WIRE HAD BEEN HEATED AND HAD MELTED THE INSULATION BACK APPROXIMATELY 3.5 INCHES FROM THE THERMITE CONNECTION.  SOME OF THE METAL CABLE STRANDS WHERE THE INSULATION HAD MELTED BACK SHOWED DISCOLORATION.   ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS A SMALL AMOUNT OF DISCOLORATION ON THE SURFACE OF THE PIPE SURROUNDING THE LEAK.   NO CORROSION, DENTS, CRACKS OR GOUGES WERE FOUND ON THE SURFACE OF THE PIPE.  THE LEAK WAS THE SIZE OF A PIN HOLE AND APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURRED DUE TO ELECTRICAL ARCING FROM THE NEGATIVE HEADER CABLE TO THE PIPE SURFACE.     CORROSION TECHNICIAN REPORTS THE CPU UNIT ""SIMMS"" WAS INSTALLED IN AUGUST 1990, AND IS SUBJECT TO HIGH LIGHTNING STRIKES AND POWER SURGES.  THE RECTIFIER HAS BEEN STRUCK BY LIGHTING A NUMBER OF TIMES BLACKING THE INSIDE OF THE RECTIFIER CASE.  ON ONE OCCURRENCE, A  LIGHTING STRIKE DISLODGED THE CONNECTION BLOCK FROM THE CASE OF THE RECTIFIER.  THE CORROSION TECHNICIAN INSTALLED A SURGEX UNIT IN JUNE 2000 TO HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF REPAIRS TO THE RECTIFIER AND MINIMIZE DAMAGE FROM LIGHTING STRIKES.    THE RECTIFIER UNIT IS LOCATED WITHIN 30 FT FROM WHERE THE LEAK OCCURRED.     TRANSWESTERN DID A THROUGH REVIEW OF CP RECORDS FROM 2003 AND FOUND NO INDICATION OF THE CP PROBLEMS OR A CHANGE IN THE CP SYSTEMS CIRCUIT RESISTANCE.  THE OVER ALL CIRCUIT RESISTANCE WAS FROM 0.47 OHMS TO 0.85 OHMS.  THE PIPE TO SOIL POTENTIALS ARE BETWEEN -3 TO -4 VOLTS, WITH INSTANT OFF READINGS BETWEEN -1 TO -1.25 VOLTS.   THE HIGH VOLTAGE POTENTIALS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CP GROUND BED BEING LOCATED WITHIN 30 FT. OF THE PIPELINE.       CONCLUSION ' THE CAUSE OF THE LEAK IS ATTRIBUTED TO METAL LOSS FROM ELECTRICAL ARCING BETWEEN THE NEGATIVE HEADER CABLE AND THE PIPE SURFACE FROM LIGHTING STRIKES.  A PREVIOUS ILI TOOL RUN THAT WAS CONDUCTED MARCH 2003 SHOWED NO WALL LOSS ANOMALY'S AT THIS LOCATION.     **THIS REPORT IS BEING SUBMITTED IN RESPONSE TO PHMSA'S REQUEST, (DOCKET ID PHMSA-2013-0028), FOR SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTS FROM OPERATORS WHO SUBMITTED REPORTS FOR INCIDENTS OCCURRING AFTER JANUARY 1, 2010, WITH ANY OF THE FOLLOWING:  (1) ``PIPE GIRTH WELD'' WAS SELECTED AS THE ``ITEM INVOLVED IN INCIDENT'' IN PART C3 OF THE REPORT.

THE TECHNICIAN WENT OUTSIDE TO DISCOVER AN ESD SYSTEM VENT VALVE, ESV-303, 100% OPEN.  THE TECHNICIAN THEN VERIFIED THERE WAS NOT AN ACTIVE ESD CONDITION ON THE STATION CONTROL COMPUTER.  THE TECHNICIAN THEN PHONED A STATION OPERATOR TO ASSIST.  THE STATION OPERATOR ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 10:20 AM AND CLOSED A 12 INCH VALVE TO ISOLATE THE STATION FROM L-25.  THE GAS RELEASE THROUGH ESV-303 IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO DECREASE.  AS THE NOISE GENERATED BY THE VENTING GAS SUBSIDED, THE OPERATOR THEN HEARD GAS BLOWING FROM A SECOND VENT VALVE, ESV-193, WITHIN THE COMPRESSOR YARD.  THE OPERATOR THEN CLOSED A 16 INCH VALVE TO ISOLATE THE STATION FROM L-127.  WITH THE STATION COMPLETELY ISOLATED FROM ALL CONNECTING PIPELINES, THE STATION PIPING QUICKLY VENTED TO ATMOSPHERE AND WAS FULLY DEPRESSURED AT 10:26 AM.  THE I&E TECHNICIAN RETURNED TO THE CONTROL COMPUTER TO FIND AN ACTIVE ESD ALARM AND A UNIT 1056 COMPRESSOR SHUTDOWN ALARM HAD OCCURRED WHILE HE WAS OUTSIDE OF THE OFFICE.  AN INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT.  THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE INADVERTENT GAS RELEASE WAS CAUSED BY THE UNPLANNED OPENING OF TWO ACTUATED EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN VENT VALVES DUE TO INADEQUATE PILOT GAS PRESSURE.  AN INSPECTION OF PILOT GAS SYSTEM TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE OF FOREIGN MATTER SUCH AS PIPE SCALE, PIPELINE CONTAMINANTS, ETC. WILL BE PERFORMED.  IN ADDITION, THE CONTINUED USE OF THE VALVE OPERATORS CURRENTLY INSTALLED ON THE EMERGENCY VENT VALVES WILL BE EVALUATED.  UPDATE JULY 30, 2010:  AN INSPECTION OF THE PILOT GAS SYSTEM REVEALED THAT NO FOREIGN MATTER WAS PRESENT IN THE PILOT GAS FILTRATION ASSEMBLY OR THE PILOT GAS REGULATORS.  THE REGULATORS WERE REPLACED WITH NEW LIKE KIND.  FINANCES HAVE BEEN APPROPRIATED FOR THE REPLACEMENT OF ALL EXISTING ESD VENT VALVE ACTUATORS.  MATERIALS HAVE BEEN ORDERED AND INSTALLATION HAS BEGUN.  UPDATE MAY 26, 2011: REPLACEMENT OF ESD VENT VALE ACTUATORS IS COMPLETE.  UPDATE MARCH 5, 2013:  COMPLETED SECTION E.5.F."

ON FEBRUARY 7, 2010 PERMANENT REPAIRS WERE MADE TO THE LINE BY PIPE REPLACEMENT.    FACTS, CIRCUMSTANCES, AND CONDITIONS THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY TO CAUSING THE INCIDENT    THE LEAK WAS THE RESULT OF A THOUGH-WALL CRACK IN THE GIRTH WELD JOINING THE 1.000' WT INDUCTION BEND TO 0.600' WT PIPE TRANSITION PIPE.     THE CRACK WAS THE RESULT OF HYDROGEN-ASSISTED CRACKING (HAC).     HAC MOST LIKELY THE RESULT OF MARGINAL HEAT INPUT OR PRE-HEAT AT THE 6 O'CLOCK POSITION WHICH PROMOTED RETENTION OF DIFFUSIBLE HYDROGEN WITHIN THE WELD. MARGINAL HEAT INPUT WAS LIKELY THE RESULT OF COLD AND WINDY CONDITIONS PRESENT DURING THE DAY OF WELDING. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF CRACKING ELSEWHERE IN THE WELD.     THE CRACK OCCURRED ON THE FACTORY END OF AN INDUCTION BEND AT A LOCATION WITH OPTIMUM WELD FIT-UP. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT WELD FIT-UP DID NOT PLAY ANY ROLE IN THE INITIATION OF THE HYDROGEN CRACK.

A FIRE WAS DISCOVERED, BY A NORTHERN NATURAL GAS COMPANY EMPLOYEE, AT THE REDFIELD UNDERGROUND STORAGE FIELD, LOCATED NEAR REDFIELD, IOWA, IN THE SL PETER UNDERGROUND STORAGE FORMATION AT WHAT IS CALLED THE MAHER #3  WELL SITE IN SECTION 12, T19N, R29W, DALLAS COUNTY, IOWA. THERE WAS NO EXPLOSION, NO INJURIES, NO EVACUATIONS AND NO LOSS OF SERVICE TO CUSTOMERS.     AT APPROXIMATELY 24:00 HOURS THE ST PETER FORMATION PIPELINE SYSTEM PORTION, OF THE STORAGE FIELD, WAS ISOLATED AND PRESSURE WAS BLOWN DOWN ON THE PIPING TO 5 PSIG TO ENABLE SAFE CLOSURE OF THE MAHER #3 WELL HEAD VALVE (SEE PAGE 2, ITEM 15A). THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY 01:50 A.M. THE FIRE DESTROYED THE WELL HOUSE BUILDING AND ALL OF THE COMPONENTS WITHIN THE BUILDING BUT THE WELL HEAD VALVE AND PIPING WERE UNAFFECTED. THE PORTION OF THE ST. PETER PIPING, THAT WAS ISOLATED IN ORDER TO FACILITATE REDUCTION IN PRESSURE FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE MAHER #3 WELL HEAD VALVE, WAS RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATION PRESSURES AT APPROXIMATELY 12:00 A.M. ON MONDAY, JANUARY 11TH (SEE PAGE 2, ITEM 15B).    PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A POST INCIDENT INVESTIGATION IDENTIFIED THAT THE GAS LEAKAGE APPEARED TO BE FROM A BROKEN ONE-INCH UNION ON THE WELL SEPARATOR DRAIN LINE. THE UNION'S THREADS APPEARED TO BE STRIPPED OR PULLED. AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE WAS 21 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND THE WIND WAS OUT OF THE WEST AT APPROXIMATELY 14 MILES PER HOUR. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FREEZING AND HEAVING MAY HAVE CREATING SUFFICIENT THERMAL STRESS WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEPARATION OF THE THREADS ON THE ONE-INCH UNION. THE NIGHT BEFORE THE FAILURE THERE WAS AN APPROXIMATE LOW TEMPERATURE OF - 19 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT IN THE AREA. ADDITIONAL METALLURGICAL FAILURE ANALYSIS IS BEING CONDUCTED TO ASSIST WITH DETERMINING WHETHER THERMAL STRESS FROM THE COLD TEMPERATURES COULD BE A ROOT CAUSE FOR STRIPPING OF THE THREADS AND THE UNION'S FAILURE.    FINAL REPORT: A METALLURGICAL EXAMINATION OF THE FAILED ONE-INCH UNION INDICATED THAT TWO PORTIONS OF THE UNION'S THREADS DEMONSTRATED ROLLED DAMAGE TO THE TOP OF THE THREADS, WHICH INDICATES THE COMPONENT PULLED OVER THE PEAK OF THE THREAD AS IT DISENGAGED. AN EXAMINATION OF THE THREADS ALSO INDICATES ONE FLATTENED/ROUNDED LOCATION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN DAMAGED OR IMPROPERLY MACHINED PREVIOUS TO THE FAILURE. THE FITTING WAS INSTALLED IN 2006, AND MAY HAVE BEEN FAULTY AND THE FROZEN CONDITION OF THE DRAIN LINE, ON DECEMBER 10, 2010, MOST LIKELY CREATED THERMAL STRESS, WHICH RESULTED IN FAILURE OF THE FITTING. AS A MEASURE TO PREVENT RECURRENCE, ALL WELL SEPARATOR DRAIN LINES AT THE REDFIELD, IOWA UNDERGROUND STORAGE FACILITY WERE DISSEMBLED AND INSPECTED. NO OTHER ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WERE FOUND. THE FIRE APPEARS TO HAVE STARTED IMMEDIATELY AS THERE WAS NO INDICATION OF AN EXPLOSION.

GAS CONTROL SAW A CORRESPONDING PRESSURE DROP VIA THE SCADA SYSTEM. A FAILURE HAD OCCURED ON SNG'S 24 INCH 2ND NORTH MAIN PIPELINE. SNG FIELD PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO CLOSE VALVES FOR ISOLATION OF THE FAILURE SITE AND TAKE THE AFFECTED SEGMENT OF PIPELINE OUT OF SERVICE. THE FAILURE WAS CAUSED BY A CLUSTER OF EXTERNAL CORROSION PITS WITH SUBSEQUENT NEAR-NEUTRAL PH STRESS CORROSION CRACKING (SCC) CONFINED WITHIN A LOCALIZED AREA OF THE MOST SEVERE CORROSION.  THE EVIDENCE GATHERED DURING THE INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED THAT THE EXTERNAL CORROSION WHICH INITIATED THIS FAILURE ALLOWED ELECTROCHEMICAL CORROSION TO THIN THE PIPE WALL, INCREASING THE LOCALIZED STRESSES, WHICH CROSSED THE THRESHOLD FOR SCC TO INITIATE AND PROPAGATE UNTIL THE REMAINING PIPE WALL COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURE."

THE HOT WATER HEATER AND THE GAS METER WERE LOCATED ADJACENT TO ONE ANOTHER IN THE CLOSET, NOT MORE THAN SIX INCHES APART WITH THE METER SETTING ON THE FLOOR.  A SERVICEMAN WAS MAKING A ROUTINE METER CHANGE AT THIS PROPERTY BUT FOUND HIMSELF HAVING DIFFICULTY TURNING THE METER OFF AT THE VALVE DUE TO THE FACT THE VALVE WAS LOCATED BEHIND THE METER AND THE WATER TANK WITH LITTLE ROOM FOR LEVERAGE.  THE SERVICEMAN TURNED THE VALVE ABOUT ""HALFWAY"" AND COULD NOT TURN IT ANY FURTHER.  THE EMPLOYEE THEN PROCEEDED TO LOOSEN THE CORE NUT ON THE VALVE MAKING IT EASIER TO TURN.  HE THEN TAPPED THE CORE WITH A CRESCENT WRENCH, AND AT THIS MOMENT, GAS ESCAPED FROM THE VALVE AND WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY IGNITED BY EITHER THE PILOT LIGHT OR BURNER OF THE ADJACENT HOT WATER HEATER.  THEFIRE BEING FED BY ESCAPING GAS CAUGHT THE WALL ON FIRE BEHIND THE WATER HEATER. THE FLAMES PROCEEDED THROUGH THE CEILING AND INTO THE ATTIC AREA.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED, AND THE FIRE WAS COMPLETELY EXTINQUISHED.  DAMAGES WERE APPROXIMATELY $6,000.  METER SETTING WAS MOVED OUTSIDE PRIOR TO TURNING GAS BACK ON."

APPARENTLY THE BURNER WAS CYCLED SEVERALTIMES IN AN ATTEMPT TO TROUBLESHOOT THE PROBLEM WHICH RESULTED IN A BUILDUP OF OIL AND VAPOR CAUSING THE DISTURBANCE.  AT THE PRESENT TIME, IT IS OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE DISTURBANCE WAS CAUSED BY REPEATED ATTEMPTS BY THE SERVICEPERSONS TO IGNITE THE BURNER ON OIL.  THESE REPEATED ATTEMPTS RESULTED IN FLOODING THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER WITH OIL WHICH CAUSED THE OIL TO SOAK INTO THE FIREBACK.  IN ADDITION, SINCE THE OIL IS SPRAYED IN WITH AN ATOMIZER, THE COMBUSTION CHAMBER WAS FILLED WITH A CLOUD OF OIL.

(NEW HAVEN DIV) RECEIVED A TELEPHONE NOTIFICATIN FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF SPINELLO CONSTRUCTION THAT THEY HAD ACCIDENTLY BROKEN A 4"" CAST IRON LOW PRESSURE GAS MAIN IN WASHINGTON DTREET AT THE INTERSECTION OF ERNA STREET,MILFORD. THE CITY OF MILFORD IS CURRENTLY UNDERTAKING A THREE YEAR SANITARY SEWER IMPROVEMENT PROJECT OF WHICH SPINOLLO CONSTRUCTION HAS A MAJOR PORTION. A CALL BEFORE YOU DIG NOTICE WAS SENT TO OUR OFFICE ON JUNE 26, 1985 FOR EXCAVATING WORK TO COMMERCE ON JUNE 28, 1985. A COMPANY INPECTOR MARKED THE AREA WITH SPRAY PAINT ON EXISTING PAVEMENT ON JUNE 27, 1985. SINCE THAT DATE A COMPANY INSPECTORHAS VISITED THE JOB SITE DAILY TO REVIEW THE RELATION OF THE SEWER WORK TO OUT EXISTING FACILITIES. BOTH THE AREA INSPECTOR, BART AMENDOLA, AND THE GENERAL FOREMAN, ANTHONY PANICO, WERE IMMEDIATLY DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE. BOTH WERE ALREADYIN MILFORD. BART ARRIVED FIRST(11:15AM) AND FOUND THAT THE CONTRACTOR HAD EXCAVATED A 12'X12' HOLE (15' DEEP) AND WAS INSTALLING A MANHOLE. THE 4"" CAST IRON LOW PRESSURE(.25 PSIG) MAIN WAS FOUND SEVERED IN HALF AT A POINT 1'(+-) BACK FROM THE EDGE OF THE TRENCH. THE MAIN WAS 3' (+-) DEEP. THE CONTRACTOR HAD STUFFED BOTH ENDS OF THE MAIN (ATWO-WAY FEED EXISTED) WITH RAGS IN AN ATTEMPT TO SLOW DOWNTHE LEAK. BART ATTEMPTED TO REACH THE BREAK IN AN EFFORT TO SECURE IT BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL. AT 11:25AM THE GENERAL FOREMAN ARRIVED. SEEING THE SITUATION HE IMMEDIATELY REQUESTED A MMAINS AND SERVICES DEPARTMENT CREW WHICH ARRIVED AT 11:55AM. IN THE MEANTIME, ANTHONY PANICO ORDERED THE CONTRACTOR TO MAKE THE MAIN ACCESSIBLE TO US BY BACKFILLING THE HOLE TO A DEPTH THAT WOULD MAKE OUR LINEREACHABLE. THE CONTRACTOR AGREED AND BEGAN THE OPERATION. OUR PERSONNEL STOOD-BY WHILE THE BACKFILLING TOOK PLACE. AT 12:48PM THE MAINS AND SERVICES DEPARTMENT RECEIVED A CALL FROM ANTHONY PANICO THAT THE MAIN HAD IGNITED. HE STATED THAT OUR OWN FIRE EXTINQUISHER WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN PUTTING OUT THE FLAMES AND THAT THE FIRE DPARTMENT WAS REQUIRED. AN EMERGENCY CALL WAS PUT IN TO THE MILFORD FIRE DEPARTMENT. ONCE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED THEY WERE DIRECTED TO HOSE DOWN THE AREA AROUND THE FLAMES TO KEEP THE PAVEMENT COOL. ANTHONY PANICO THEN BEGAN PROCEDURESTO STOP THE FLOW OF GAS AND EXTINQUISH THE FLAMES. THIS WAS TO BE ACCOMPLISHED BY EXCAVATING A FEW HUNDRED FEET AWAY FROM THE FIRE ON EACH SIDE AND TO EXCAVATETWO HOLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF STOPPING THE FLOW OF GAS FROM EACH DIRECTION. A SECOND MAINS AND SERVICES DEPARTMENT CREW WAS CALLED IN FROM WEST HAVEN TO ASSIST.AN EXISTING SERVICE TAP WAS USED ON ONE SIDE AND A NEW TAP PROVIDED ON THE OTHER TO INSTALL RUBBER BAGS IN THE MAIN. THIS WAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED AND THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED AT 1:40 PM. THE STOPPAGE OF GAS EXTINGUISED THE FIRE BUT ALSO KILL THE FEED TO ERNA ST AND NORTHERLY WHICH IS DEAD END. THE RESULTING EFFECT LEFT 30 TO 35 ACCOUNTS OFF.JOHN KAISER FROM THE CONSUMER SERVICE DEPT WAS SENT TO THE AREA TO SUPERVISE THE HANDLING OF THE PILOT OUTAGE. FURTHER INVESTIGATION BYBART AMENDOLA AND ANTHONY PANICO DETERMINED THAT THE MARKINGS OF THE GAS MAIN WERE 6' OFF OF THE ACTUAL LOCATION. THIS MEANT THAT THE CONTRACTOR WAS ONLY 1' AWAY FROM THE GAS MAIN INSTEAD OF 7' AS HE THOUGHT. ACTUAL LOCATIONS IN THE FIELD WERE TAKEN BY BART AMENDOLA AFTER THE FLAMES WERE EXTINGUISHED. HIS MEASUREMENTSSHOW THAT THE LOCATION USED BY THE INSPECTOR FROM THE COMPANY RECORDS ON JUNE 27 WERE NOT CORRECT; I.E. 6' OFF. I ATTRIBUTR THIS TO THE FACT THAT WASHINGTON STREET HAD BEEN WIDENED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE 1912 ( DATE OF MAIN INSTALLATION ) BUTTHE LOCATIONS USED BY THE INSPECTOR WERE AS-BUILTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS HAVE BEEN CORRECTED. THE SOURCE OF IGNITION IS OF AN UNDETERMINED ORIGIN. NO ONE AT THE"

AROUND ONE OF OUR GAS SERVICE METERS. THE WHEATCROFT VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT REPORTED TO THE CLAY POLICE DEPRTMENT THAT THEY HAD PUT OUT THE FIRE AND IT HAD REIGNITED AND THEY THOUGHT IT WAS A GAS LEAK. THIS CALL CAME IN AT APPROXIMATELY 3:20AM. THE CLAY POLICE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC WORKS WHO ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 3:30AM AND FOUND THE GAS TO BE LEAKING FROM A .75"" SERVICE LINE APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET FROM THE METER. HE IMMEDIATELY CLOSED VALVES AT THE TOWN BORDER STATION INTERRUPTING SERVICE TO 76 CUSTOMERS. CITYCREWS DUG THE SERVICE LINE UP WHERE IT CONNECTED TO THE MAIN, CUT AND CAPPED THE CONNECTION. LOCAL RADIO STATIONS WERE ALERTED TO THE SITUATIN AT 6:00AM AND THE CITY CREWS STARTED THE SHUT DOWN PROCEDURES. BY 7:45AM ALL SERVICES WERE SHUT OFF AT THE METER AND THE SYSTEM WAS PRESSURED UP AND PURGED AT THREE LOCATIONS. THE START UP PROCEDURE WAS CARRIED OUT BY THREE CREWS WITH ALL BUT SEVEN CUSTOMERS SERVICE RESTORED BY 11:00AM. THE SEVEN CUSTOMERS NOT AT HOME HAD THEIR METERSSECURED AND FLAGGED WITH A CARD EXPLAINING THE SHUT OFF AND INSTRUCTIONS  FOR CONTACTING THE GAS DEPARTMENT FOR RESTORATION OF SERVICE. THE SERVICE LINE WAS INSPECTED B CITY WORKERS AND FIRE PERSONNEL AND THE PERSON WHO FIRST REPORTED THE FIRE WAS INTERVIEWED. OUR FINDINGS WERE THAT THE CUSTOMERS PIPING LEFT THE METERRAN ALONG SIDE THE BUILDING WHERE IT CAME IN CONTACT WITH A 1.5"" COPPER VENT LINE WHICH EXTENTED ABOVE THE BUILDING APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET. EYE WITNESSES SAID THAT LIGHTENING STRUCK AROUND THE BUILDING AND THEN THE FIRE OCCURED. INSPECTION BY GAS PERSONNEL FOUND WHERE LIGHTENING STRUCK THE VENT AND TRAVELED DOWN THE CUSTOMERS PIPING TO WHERE THE METER RISER WAS JOINED TO THE SERVICE. THE METER RISER WAS PLASTIC AND NOT BONDED ACROSS TO THE STEEL SERVICE. IT APPEARS THAT WHEN THE CURRENT TRIED TO ARC ACROSS THE STEEL CASING FROM THE RISER TO THE SERVICE THE PLASTIC MELTED. THERE WAS APPROXIMATELY A 2"" LENGTH OF PLASTIC BETWEEN THE STEEL RISER CASING AND THE STEEL SERVICE LINE. THEIS STRUCTURE IS STORED AT THE CITY WAREHOUSE. SUBSEQUENT INSPECTIONS HAVE FOUND THE SYSTEM TO BE IN NORMAL OPERATING CONDITION. THE CITY WILL NOT RECONNECT THIS SERVICE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER CORRECTS HIS PIPE ROUTING. THE CITY IS INITIATING AN INSPECTION PROGRAM TO INSURE THAT NO OTHER SITUATIONS SIMILAR EXIST. THERE WAS NO PROPERTY DAMAGE OR INJURY INVOLVED DURING THIS INCIDENT."

THE FLEXIBLE RANGE CONNECTOR WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SMALL HOLE AND A CRACK IN IT. INVESTIGATIONS WITH COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR AND FLAME IONIZATION UNIT DID NOT DETECT ANY GAS IN THE BASEMENT, FOUNDATION WALL, AREA AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF THE HOME OR SEWER. GAS WAS NOT ENTERING THE BUILDING FROM THE UNDERGROUND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.

THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE OCCURRED IN A PRIVATE DWELLING LOCATED AT 316 EAST PHILADELPHIA STREET IN RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA.  THERE WERE TWO OCCUPANTS IN THE OCCUPANTS WERE IN BED SLEEPING AND WERE AWAKENED BY THE EXPLOSION.  THEY FOUND THAT THE LIVING ROOM OF THEIR DWELLING WAS ENGULFED IN FLAMES, AND THEY ESCAPED THE HOUSE THROUGH THEIR BEDROOM WINDOW.IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT THE EXPLOSION WAS A RESULT OF AN ACCCUMULATION OF NATURAL GAS THAT ORIGINATED AT A LEAK ON THE GAS MAIN IN THE ALLEY BEHIND THE RESIDENCE.  APPARENTLY THE GAS TRAVELED UNDERGROUND UNDER THE FROST LINE FROM THE MAIN TO THE SERVICE LINE AT 316 EAST PHILADELPHIA AND UP TO THE DWELLING.  THE NATURAL GAS PROBABLY ENTERED THE DWELLING FROM A CRAWL SPACE AT THE SERVICE ENTERANCE AND WAS IGNITED THE INTERIOR OF THE HOUSE.  THE RAPID CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD THE FIRE UNDER CONTROL IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES.WE IMMEDIATELY BAR TESTED IN THE ALLEY AND IN THE YARDS ABUTTING THE ALLEY AND FOUND A MAJOR CONCENTRATION OF NATURAL GAS.

THE BUILDING WAS BEING RENOVATED AND WAS TO OPEN SOMETIME IN THE SPRING AS A BAR. THERE WERE NO UTILITIES CONNECTED TO THE SITE=--NO GAS, WATER, ELECTRICITY, OR TELEPHONE. THE BUILDING WAS TOTALLY DOMOLISHED. THE SAPULPA FIRE DEPT. AND POLICE DEPT. ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 0522 HOURS. THEY DID NOT RECEIVED A CALL BUT HAD RESPONDED TO THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION. THE EXPLOSION WAS HEARD OVER A WIDE AREA. DEAN WISE, SAPULPA FIRE MARSHAL, ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 0555 HOURS. HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE POLICE DEPT. HAD CONTACTED THE FEDERAL ALCOHOL. TABACCO, AND FIREARMS DIVISION. DEAN WISE CONTACTED AHT STATE FIRE MARSHAL FIELD AGENT. THE WEATHER DATA AT 0448 HOURS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE INDICATED THE WEATHER CONDITIONS WERE  ""FOG, 24 DEGREES, HUMIDITY 96 PERCENT, WIND SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST AT 9.5 MILES PER HOUR, THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE AT 30.37.""  THE FIRST OKLAHOMA NATURAL GAS COMPANY EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ONT EH SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 0630 HOURS. HIGHWAY66 WAS TOTALLY BLOCKED BY DEBIRS FROMTHE BLAST. INITIAL OBSERVATION UPON ARRIVING WAS A SLIGHT ODOR OF NATURAL GAS, AND THERE WERE SEVERAL SMALL FIRES BURING AROUND THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE BUILDING SLAB. AN INITIAL FLAME-PACK SURVEY OF THE BLAST SITE INDICATED GAS AROUND THE BUILDING SLAB. A FLAME PACK OF THE GAS LINE ALONG THE FRONT OF THE BUILDING INDICATED ONE LEAK NEAR THE EAST EDGE OF THE EDGE OF THE PROPERTY. A 2-INCH PLASTIC LINE THAT SERVED THE AREA WAS CLAMPED OF NEAR THE NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE PROPERTY,  APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET AWAY. STATE OF OK FIRE MARSHALL AGENT SHELLY PHILLIPS AND A GROUPOF DEFERAL ALCOHOL, TOBACCO, AND FIREARMS DIVISION (ATF) EMPLOYEES LED BY LOU JOBSON, ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AROUND 0830 HOURS. THEIR INITIAL REACTION WASA ""CLASSIC DYNAMITE CASE.""  THE PRESENCE OF GAS WAS ORIGINALLYY THOUGHT TO BE THE RESULT OF THE BLAST. LOU JOHNSON OF THE ATF DIVISION APPARENTLY SSUMEDJURISDICTION OF THE INVESTIGATION ALONG WITH FIRE MARSHALL AGENT SHELLY PHILLIPS BECAUSE THEY ASSUMED IT WAS A DELIBERATELY CAUSED EXPLOSIVE USED. THE DOZER ARRIVED AND STARTED CLEARING THE SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 HOURS. OKLAHOMA NATURAL GAS EMPLOYEES MET WITH DEAN WISE AND SHELLY PHILLIPS AND WERE UPDATED ON THE SITUATION. GAS WAS STILL NOT BEING CONSIDERED AS THE SOURCE OF EXPLOSION AT THIS TIME. OKLAHOMA NATURAL GAS CONTINUED TO TAKE CGI READINGS AROUNT THE SITE. THE READINGS VARIED FROM 20 PERCENT TO 100 PERCENT GAS AROUND THE FILL AREA. WE SUSPECTED THE GAS WAS FROM SOME OTHER SOURCE DUE TO THE IDISTANCE FROM OUR GAS LINE. AT ATF TEAM COMPLETED CLEARING THE BUILDING SLAB AND FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF HIGH EXPLOSIVES. AT THIS TIME LOU JOBSONN OF THE ATF TEAM MADE A PRELIMIANARY REPORT RULING OUT THE USE OF EXPLOSIVES IN THEE BLAST AND INDICATED THE BLAST WAS PROBABLY DUE TO NATURAL GAS FROM AN UNKNOWNSOURCE. THE OKLAHOMA STATE FIRE MARSHAL REQUESTED A CHECK OF ODORANT LEVEL IN OUR GAS LINE. AN ODOR OF MERCAPTAN AT THE BLAST SITE WAS NOT APPARENT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE PICKING UP VOLUME GAS READINGS ALL AROUND THE AREA. AN ODORANT LEVEL IN OUR GAS LINE. AN ODOR OF MERCAPTAN AT THE BLAST SITE WAS NOT APPARENT EVEN THOUGH WE WERE PICKING UP VOLUME GAS READINGS ALL AROUND THE AREA. AN ODORANT TEST USING A HEATH ODOR TESTER, MODEL 5637, WAS RUN AT A GAS METER NEXT TO THE BLAST SITE; THE  ODORANT LEVEL INDICATED WAS 0.40 PERCENT OF GAS WHICH IS CONSIDERED TO BE NORMAL.

THE EXPLOSION DESTROYED THE BUILDING AND CAUSED SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE ADJACENT BUILDINGS; HOWEVER, THERE WERE ONLY MINOR INJURIES TO THREE PEOPLE IN THE VICINITY.  THE NEW ORLEANS FIRE DEPARTMENT (NOFD) NOTIFIED THE GAS DISPATCHER AT NEW ORLEANS PUBLIC SERICE (NOPSI) AT 12:33 AM.  A GAS SERVICEMAN WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT APPROXIMATELT 12:45AM. UPON ARRIVAL THE SERVICEMAN NOTED A SMALL LEAK AT THE INSULATED UNION IN THE SERVICE RISER.  THE SERVICE RISER WAS LOCATED OUTSIDE THE BUILDING NEAR THE GROUND APPROXIMATELY THREE INCHES FROM THE BUILDING FOUNDATION.  THE LEAK WAS OBVIOUSLY CAUSED BY THE EXPLOSION WHICH BENT THE SERVICE RISER THEREBY CRACKING THE INSULATOR.  THE RISER WAS IMMEDIATELY REMOVED AND THE SERVICE WAS CAPPED-OFF.  THE ADJACENT AREA WAS THEN CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF NATURAL GAS WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR (CGI) AND NO MEASURABLE QUANTITY OF GAS WAS FOUND.  AT THAT TIME THE AREA WAS DEEMED SAFE.  NOPSI RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE RESIDENCE IS SERVED BY ONE (1) GAS SERVICE WITH A THREE (3) METER SET AND THREE(3) METER SHUT-OFF VALVES WHICH, ACCORDING TO MOPSI RECORDS, WERE OFFAND LOCKED AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION.  HOWEVER, THE SERVICEMAN NOTED THATTHE  METER VALVE TO APARTMENT A WAS NOT LOCKED AND THE VALVE WAS IN THE  OPEN POSITION.  THE READING ON THE METER IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE EXPLOSION WAS 0342.  NOPSI RECORDS INDICATE THAT THE READING TAKEN WHEN THE METER WAS SHUT (I.E. VALVE TURNED-OFF AND LOCKED) WAS 0331.  THEREFORE, AN UNAUTHORIZED CONSUMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY 11 CCF WAS INDICATED.  JOSEPH F. RICKS JR., ANOPSI REPRESENTATIVE, INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT AND FOUND THAT THE EXPLOSIONAPPARENTLY RESULTED WHEN NATURAL GAS ACCUMULATED IN APARTMENT A FROM AN OPENOR FAILED CUSTOMER FUEL LINE AND WAS IGNITED.  THE SOURCE OF IGNITION IS UNKNOWN AT THE PRESENT TIME."

LOCAL TIME, THE OPERATOR RECEIVED, THROUGH THE CONTROL PANEL, AN INDICATION THAT GAS DETECTOR NO. 4 HAD SENSED THE PRESENCE OF ESCAPING GAS AT THE STORAGE CONTAINER.  MR. DOVER INVESTIGATED AND FOUND ESCAPING GAS AT VALVE NO. FVO2 (LIQUIFIED FLOW VALVE).  VALVE NO. FVO2 CONTROLS THE FLOW OF GAS FROM THE STORAGE CONTAINER TO THE VAPORIZER.  MR. DOVER IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE LNG SYSTEM AND NOTIFIED MR. JAMES A. DAWSON, GENERAL MANAGER, OF THE SITUATION.  MR DAWSON ARRIVED AT THE LNG SATELLITE FACILITY AT APPROXIMATELY 6:05 P.M. LOCAL TIME.  UPON INVESTIGATING THE LEAKING VALVE, THE CAUSE AND LOCATION OF WHICH WAS UNDERTERMINED AT THE TIME, MR. DAWSON CALLED THE FORT PAYNE POLICE DEPARTMENT (EMERGENCY PLAN) AND REQUESTED THAT 38TH STREET BE CLOSED TO TRAFFIC AND THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT BE NOTIFIED TO REPORT TO THE LNG SATELLITE FACILITY.  MR. DAWSON FURTHER REQUESTED THAT SOUTHERN RAILWAY BE CALLED AND ADVISED OF THE SITUATION AND REQUESTED TO STOP ALL NORTH AND SOUTHBOUND TRAFFIC ON THE ADJACENT SINGLE TRACK MAIN LINE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 6:10 PM. LOCAL TIME, MR. DAWSON CALLED ROGER STEBBING, LNG SYSTEM DESIGN ENGINEER, AND WAS INFORMED THAT MR. STEBBING WAS IN EUROPE.  MR. DAWSON THEN CALLED JIM MAVITY OF MAVITY CONTROLS, TO ASSIST IN LOCATING AND REPAIRING THE LEAK AT VALVE NO. FVO2.  THE RESPONSE TIME OF MAVITY CONTROLS TO THE LNG SATELLITE FACILITY WAS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE AND ONE-HALF HOURS.  UPON ARRIVAL OF FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL, AFTER DISCUSSING THE SITUATION WITH CHIEF HARRISON, THE CHEROKEE TRAILER PARK AND DEERFIELD APARTMENTS WERE EVACUATEDAND POWER WAS DISCONNECTED BY THE FORT PAYNE IMPROVEMENT AUTHORITY (ELECTRICDEPARTMENT).  UPON MAVITY CONTROL'S ARRIVAL AT THE LNG SATELLITE FACILITY, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE NORMAL OPERATING TANK PRESSURE OF 42 LBS SHOULD BE REDUCED TO SLOW THE FLOW OF LNG AT VALVE NO. FV02.  THE STORAGE CONTAINER PRESSURE WAS REDUCED BY INJECTING LNG INTO THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, THERBY LOWERING THE PRESSURE TO APPROXIMATELY 28 LBS.  DURING THE TIME THE PRESSURE WAS BEING LOWERED ON THE STORAGE CONTAINER, THE FOLLOWING BUSINESSES WERE CLOSED AND ELECTRIC POWER DISCONNECTED BY FORT PAYNE IMPORVEMENT (ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT).  UPON REDUCTION OF THE STORAGE CONTAINER PRESSURE FROM 42 LBS TO 28 LBS, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE VALVE PACKING NUT HAD LOOSENED DURING OPERATION ANDALLOWED THE PACKING TO LOOSEN, CAUSING VALVE NO. FV02 TO LEAK AROUND THE VALVE STEM.  JIM MAVITY OF MAVITY CONTROLS, TIGHTENED THE PACKING NUT ON VALVE FV92 AND STOPPED THE ESCAPING GAS.  AFTER ALLOWING SUFFICIENT TIME FOR THE GASTO DISSIPATE, ALL VALVES, FLANGES, AND ABOVE GROUND PIPING WERE CHECKED WITHA SOUTHERN CROSS MODEL 400 FLAME IONIZATIO DETECTOR.  NO LEAKS WERE LOCATED. THE AREA AND FACILITY WERE SECURED AND THE FACILITY PLACED BACK IN SERVICE. MR. JIM MAVITY, OF MAVITY CONTROLS, ESTIMATED THE LOSS OF LNG NOT TO EXCEEDFIVE (5) GALLONS.

UNITED CITIES PERSONNEL COORDINATED THE TIE-IN OF THIS MAIN UPON COMPLETION OF A 120 PSIG PRESSURE TEST.  IT WAS DURING THIS PORTION OF THE INSTALLATION THAT THE INCIDENT OCCURRED.  WHILE WORKING WITH DETERIORATING CONDITIONS, 10 MILES PER HOUR WIND, TEMPERATURE AT 7 DEGREES F ANDAPPROACHING 11:00 P.M., WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO COMPLETE THE TIE-IN OF THIS REINFORCEMENT LINE PRIOR TO THE ANTICIPATED PEAK LOAD RESULTING FROM THE ""ARTICBLAST"" FORECAST FOR DECEMBER 22, 1989. THE CREW PREPARED TO MAKE THE TIE-IN TO THE STEEL SECTIONS WHERE A TRANSITION FITTING HAD BEEN INSTALLED.  THE INABILITY TO SECURE A COMPLETE SHUT-OFF OF GAS BY SQUEEZE-OFF ON THE TRANSITION SRESULTED IN A DECISION TO USE A 711 DRESSER COUPLING AS OPPOSED TO BUTT FUSION, WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED THE USE OF THE ELECTRIC FACER IN THE HOLE, A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS SITUATION FOR THIS JUNCTION.  HOWEVER, WHILE INSTALLING THE 711 DRESSER COUPLING GAS CONTINUED TO FILL THE BELL HOLE AND IN THE PROCESSOF SLIDING THE COUPLING INTO POSITION THERE WAS AN APPARENT DISCHARGE OF STATIC ELECTRICITY IGNITING THE GAS.  TWO OF THWORKERS, ON CONTRACTOR AND ONE UCG EMPLOYEE, WERE INJURED REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION AND ONE CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEE WAS TREATED AND RELEASED.

WHILE EXCAVAITING WITHIN THE ROADWAY, THE CITY CREW UNCOVERED A 3/4"" WRAPPED STEEL SERVICE THAT WAS BEING UTILIZED AS A GAS SERVICE FOR 4601 CANDLETREE LANE.  THIS SERVICE HAD BEEN ACCURATELY LOCATED AND MARKED ON SUNDAY, JANUARY 7, 1990, BY ASOUTHERN UNION GAS COMPANY REPRESENTATIVE IN RESPONSE TO AN EMERGENCY REQUEST FOR UTILITY LOCATIONS RECEIVED ON THAT SAME DAY.   THE CITY OF AUSTIN'S MAINTENANCE CREW PROCEDED TO FULLY EXPOSE THE GAS LINE AS IT CROSSED THEIR EXCAVATION SITE.  THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT ANY DAMAGE TO THE GAS FACILITY IN QUESTION.  HOWEVER, THE CREWS EXCAVATION SITE BEGAN TO FILL WITH WATER FROM THE LEAKING WATER TAP AT A RATE THAT THEIR WATER PUMPS COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH THE FLOW AND EVENTUALLY COVERED THE EXPOSED GAS LINE WITH WATER.  THE CITY'S MAINTENANCE CREW THEN DECIDED TO UTILIZE THE BUCKET ON THEIR BACKHOE TO DIP THE WATER FROM THE EXCAVATION SITE.  WHILE IN THE PROCESS OF DIPPING THE WATERWITH THE BACKHOE BUCKET THE OPERATOR CAUGHT THE GAS SERVICE, WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY EXPOSED, AND PROCEDED TO PULL THE SERVICE FROM THE 2"" STEEL GAS MAIN WHICH WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 6' NORTH OF THE EXCAVATION SITE.

THE SERVICE TAP WAS LOCATED UNDER THE DRIVEWAY APPROACH TO 4602 CANDLETREE LANE.  THIS REQUIRED OUR EMERGENCY MAINTENANCE CREW TO MAKE A 4' X 4' CONCRETE DRIVEWAY APPROACH CUT BEFORE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO EXPOSE THE MAIN TAP.

A HOUSE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS REPORTED AT THE CORNER OF WEST SEVIER AVENUE AND BROAD STREET IN KINGSPORT, TENNESSEE.  THE SITE WAS LATER IDENTIFIED AS 110 WEST SEVIER AVENUE, ANUNOCCUPIED TWO-STORY, FRAME STRUCTURE.  IT WAS BORDERED BY A CHURCH, RESIDENCES OF SIMILAR STRUCTURE, AND PARKING LOTS.  MANY BUILDINGS IN THE AREA SURROUNDING THE SITE HAVE REPORTED DAMAGE WHICH INCLUDE BROKEN WINDOWS, DAMAGED ROOFS AND PLASTER WALLS, AND SCRATCHED FURNITURE.  THERE ARE ALSO SOME REPORTS OF PERSONAL INJURY, PRIMARILY CAUSED BY THE GLASS FROM THE BROKEN WINDOWS.  THE INCIDENT SITE WAS A LOT CONTAINING TWO STRUCTURES, THE HOUSE IDENTIFIED ABOVE AND A TWO-UNIT APARTMENT COMPLEX AT 110 1/2 WEST SEVIER AVENUE.  THE LATTER LOCATION HAD BEEN DEMOLISHED THAT DAY BY A CONTRACTOR EMPLOYED BY THE HOLSTON VALLEY HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL CENTER.  INVESTIGATION OF THE ACCIDENT HAS REVEALED THAT A REPRESENTATIVE FROM HOLSTON VALLEY REQUESTED THE GAS SERVICE TO110 1/2 WEST SEVIER AVENUE BE TERMINATED AND THAT WE FIELD LOCATE THE GAS SERVICE LINE TO 110 WEST SEVIER AVENUE, WHICH BORDERED THE APARTMENT HOUSE.  THE REQUEST WAS COMPLETED ON FRIDAY, MARCH 23, 1990.  THE HOLSTON VALLEY REPRESENTATIVE REVIEWED THE SITE AND BEING SATISFIED THAT THE LINE WAS PHYSICALLY IDENTIFIED, PROCEEDED WITH THE DEMOLITION OF THE APARTMENT HOUSE.  THE CONTRACTOR, WHO LATER STATED HE WAS NOT INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF AN UNDERGROUND GAS LINE, DEMOLISHED AND REMOVED THE STRUCTURE AND IN THE PROCESS HE HOOKED THE GAS SERVICE LINE (3/4"" STEEL) WITH HIS EQUIPMENT.  THE LINE DID NOT BREAK AT THIS LOCATION, HOWEVER, THE STRESS RESULTED IN A BREAK NEAR A THREADED ELBOW SOME 38' 10"" AWAY.  A PORCH WHICH WAS LATER ENCLOSED HAD BEEN BUILT OVER THIS POINT CAUSING THE ENTRAPMENT OF THE ESCAPING GAS.  THIS OCCURRED SOME TIMEPRIOR TO 4:00 PM. ON MARCH 26, APPROXIMATELY FIVE HOURS PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION.  I HAVE ATTACHED A DRAWING OF THE SITE FOR BETTER REPRESENTATION.  IN CONSLUSION, IT APPEARS THE EXCAPING GAS FROM THE DAMAGED SERVICE VENTED UNDER AND INTO THE STRUCTURE FOR A MINIMUM OF FIVE HOURS.  AT APPROXIMATELY 9:00 PM. AN ELECTRICAL CONTACT FROM EITHER THE PHONE, OR THE THERMOSTAT TO THE FLOOR FURNACE MAY HAVE BEEN THE IGNITION SOURCE CAUSING THE EXPLOSION.  OUR FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE KINGSPORT FIRE DEPARTMENT, INCLUDED A PRESSURE TEST OF THE GAS FUEL LINE WHICH REMAINED INTACT AND THE GAS SERVICE LINE.  THESE TESTS CONFIRMED THE ONLY FAILURE TO EITHER OF THE SYSTEMS WAS DUE TO THE THIRD-PARTY DAMAGE."

THE COMPANY EMPLOYEE RECEIVED SECOND DEGREE BURNS TO HIS HANDS, ARMS, FACE AND NECK RESULTING IN ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL.ON JUNE 6, 1990, A CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR PENNSYLVANIA GAS & WATER COMPANY WAS RENEWING LEAD-LINED WATER SERVCIES AT 2821 N. MAIN AVENUE, SCRANTON.  AFTER UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO PULL EXISTING WATER SERVICE BENEATH THE ROADWAY, IT WAS DECIDED TO UTILIZE A PNEUMATIC PIERCING TOOL TO BORE A HOLE ACROSS THE ROAD AT A DEPTH OF APPROXIMATELY 4.5-FEET.  THE CONTRACTOR WAS TOLD THAT A SIX (6)-INCH INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE PLASTIC GAS MAIN EXISTED IN THE STREET.  THEMAIN WAS INSTALLED IN 1976 APPROXIMATELY THREE-FEET IN DEPTH AND WAS MARKED OUT A MONTH PRIOR TO START OF WORK.  IT WAS ASSUMED THAT ""SHOOTING"" THE PIERCING TOOL AT A DEPTH OF 4.5-FEET, THERE WOULD BE MINIMAL CHANCE OF THE UNIT DEFLECTING UPWARD 18-INCHES WITHIN A FEW FEET INTO THE STREET, AND THEREFORE LITTLE RISK IN STRIKING THE GAS MAIN AT ITS THREE (3)-FOOT DEPTH.  AS WORK WAS CONTINUING, THE CONTRACTOR INFORMED P.G.&W.'S INSPECTOR THAT THE TOOL WAS STRUCK BENEATH THE ROAD AND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO REVERSE THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT AND BACK IT OUT OF THE OBSTRUCTION.  UPON PERFORMING THIS ACTION, THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE ODOR OF NATURAL GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE.  IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE GAS MAIN WAS RUPTURED AND EMERGENCY PROCEDURES WERE PUT INTO EFFECT.  PREPARATIONS WERE MADE TO SHUT DOWN THE GAS MAIN AND START EVACUATION PROCEDURESIN THE AFFECTED AREA.  IT WAS DURING THIS TIME AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT 2825N. MAIN AVENUE, SCRANTON. APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE LATER, THE HOUSE BURST INTO FLAMES.  FIRE, POLICE, AND EMERGENCY AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED.  AFTER EXCAVATION AT THE LEAK SITE WAS COMPLETED, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CONTRACTOR'S PNEUMATIC PIERCING TOOL HAD STRUCK THE SIX (6)-INCH PLASTIC INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE (55 PSI) MAIN AND PUNCTURED A HOLE APPROXIMATELY 3/4-INCH DIAMETER INTO THE EASTERLY SIDE OF THE MAIN.

THE CONTRACTOR AND HIS HELPER WERE NOT INJURED, HOWEVER, ONE RESIDENT WAS TREATED AND RELEASED WHILE THE OTHER RESIDENTWAS ADMITTED AND TREATED FOR BURNS TO THE UPPER BODY.  THE EVENTS PRECEDING THE ACCIDENT BEGAN ON THIS DAY AT APPROXIMATELY 10:00 AM., WHEN A LANDSCAPINGCONTRACTOR, EMPLOYED BY THE RESIDENT, BEGAN DIGGING IN THE BACKYARD OF 908 EAST MARKET STREET.  AS A PART OF THEIR PRE-PLANNING FOR THIS PROJECT, THE CONTRACTOR DID NOT REQUEST UTILITY LOCATION THRU THE AREA UTILITIES NOR THE ""ONE-CALL"" SERVICE.  AS A RESULT, THE CONTRACTOR BROKE THE UNMARKED, 3/4"" COATED STEEL GAS SERVICE LINE NEAR THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE WHERE THE LINE HAD APPROXIMATELY 1' OF COVER.  THE RESIDENT CONTACTED OUR SERVICEMAN VIA THE ANSWERING SERVICE AND UPON ARRIVAL THE SERVICEMAN IDENTIFIED THE PROBLEM TO BE A BREAK IN THE 3/4"" SERVICE LINE PROBABLY AT THE THREADED CONNECTION WHERE THE LINE CHANGED FROM ITS HORIZONTAL ORIENTATION TO THE VERTICAL WHICH FUNCTIONED AS THE SERVICE RISER FOR THE METER INSTALLATION WHICH, IN THIS CASE, DID NOT EXIST BECAUSE THERE WAS PRESENTLY NO GAS EQUIPMENT INSTALLED IN THE HOUSE. THESERVICEMAN THEN DIRECTED THE EXCAVATION OF THE LINE TO A POINT WHERE IT COULDBE DISCONNECTED AND CAPPED SINCE THERE WAS NO  AVAILABLE VALVE TO DO SO.  THIS WAS ACCOMPLISHED SOME 50 MINUTES AFTER THE BREAK OCCURRED.  IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES LATER THAT THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED.

A SEVEN YEAR OLD BOY, STANDING OUTSIDE OF THE GARAGE INVOLVED, WAS HOSPITALIZED DUE TO BURNS.  THE EXPLOSION WAS TERMED ""A TYPICAL GAS EXPLOSION"" IN THAT THE ROOF AND WALLS BLEW OUT OF THE GARAGE AFTER AN IGNITION SOURCE, CREATED BY THE FATHER OF THE BOY INJURED, WHEN HE TRIED TO START HIS VEHICLE INSIDE THE GARAGE.  THE FATHER WAS AT THE IGNITION POINT AND WAS BLOWN CLEAR, WITH MINOR INJURIES NOT REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION.  THE SOURCE OF NATURAL GAS WAS A HOLE WORN IN THE 5/8"" PLASTIC SERVICE  LINE CAUSED BY A PIECE OF CNCRETE 48"" X 30"" WHICH WAS IN THE GROUND, LAYING ON THE SERVICE LINE.   IT WAS IN THE BACKFILL OF AN EXCAVATION SITE PERFOMRED BY STAR LINE CONSTRUCTION DURING ASEWER PROJECT CROSSING THE SUBJECT SERVICE LINE IN OCTOBER, 1990.  SUBSEQUENT SETTLING OF THE SEWER BACKFILL CREATED A FRICTION POINT ON THE SERVICE, THEREBY CREATING A LEAK.  NATURAL GAS, EXCAPING FROM THE HOLE, WAS TRAPPED BY FROST CONDITIONS ALLOWING IT TO MIGRATE TOWARD THE GARAGE STRUCTURE DAMAGED ANDVENTING INTO THE STRUCTURE."

A CONTRACTOR ENTERED THE MANHOLE ON DWIGHT STREET TO INSPECT FOR THE PRESENCE OF WATER.  ACCORDING THE WITNESSES, HE MAY HAVE LIT A BUTANE LIGHTER WHILE IN THE MANHOLE TO EITHER CHECK FOR ADEQUATE OXYGEN LEVELS OR TO SEE IF THERE WAS WATER IN THE MANHOLE.  THERE WAS A FLASH AND THE CONTRACTOR WAS BURNED ON HIS HANDS AND FACE.  A SECOND CONTRACTOR WASALSO BURNED ON THEHAND IN HELPING THE FIRST MAN OUT OF THE MANHOLE.  BOTH MEN WENT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT.  THE FIRST MAN WAS ADMITTED AND THE SECOND WAS TREATED AND RELEASED.  THE NEW HAVEN FIRE DEPARTMENT NOTIFIED US AT 1:57 PM.

THIS EXCAVATION WAS BEING DUG WITHOUT A DIG SAFE NOTIFICATION,  AND NO UTILITIES WERE MARKED ON THE SITE.  DURING THE EXCAVATING PROCESS, THE OPERATOR APPARENTLY DRAGGED THE BACKHOE BUCKET ALONG THE TOP OF THE SERVICE PIPING AND FORCED THE FOUNDATION RESULTED IN THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE SERVICE PIPE AT THE INSIDE WALL OF THE CELLAR.  IN TURN, THE CORPORATION COCK ON THE SERVICE WAS DRAWN INTO THE FIELDSTONE FOUNDATION WALL, AND THE RESULTING STRESS ON THE PIPING CAUSED THE BASEMENT TEE TO SEPARATE FROMTHE SERVICE LINE AT THE CORPORATION COCK THREADS, CAUSING THE RELEASE OF HIGH PRESSURE (25 PSIG) GAS DIRECTLY INTO THE CELLAR.

I ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION APPROXIMATELY 2:15P.M. AND FOUNS THAT THE 2"" P.V.C. GAS MAIN HAD BEEN HIT BY A BACK HOE. LINE WAS CUT IN TWO. INSEATED PLUG (2"") AND STOPPED FLOW OF GAS.  I ADVISED,R. EMILIO MARTINEZ, OWNER, THAT HE SHOULD HAVE CALLED US TO LOCATE LINE BEFORE HE STARTED DIGGING.  HE SAID HE DIDN'T REMEMBER THAT A GAS LINE WAS THERE, SO CLOSE TO HIS SEWER LINE.  I CALLED CREW FOREMAN, LARRY MARTINEZ, AND ADVISED AS TO WHAT HAD HAPPEDNED AND HE AND HIS CREW SECURED WHERE THEY WERE WORKING AND WENT TO 925 OAK TO REPAIR DAMAGED GAS LINE.  I WAS TOLD LATER THAT LINE HAD BEEN REPAIRED AND THAT ALL UNITS HAD BEEN RELIT (7 TO 8 TRAILERS), ATABOUT 4:45 P.M.  AT ABOUT 9:50 P.M. I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE CITY P.D. THAT AN EXPLOSION HAD OCCURRED AND THAT A FIRE WAS IN PROCESS AT A LOCATION ON OAK STREET.  I THOUGHT THEN, THAT THIS MIGHT BE RELATED TO WHAT HAD HAPPENED EALIER.  I CALLED LARRY MARTINEZ AND TOLD HIM WHAT I HAD BEEN TOLD BY THE P.D.DISPATCHER AND TOLD HIM TO MEET ME AT THE LOCATION A.S.A.P.  WHEN I ARRIVED,APPROXIMATELU TEN (10) MINUTES AFTER HAVING RECEIVED THE CALL, LARRY MET ME. HE THEN LEFT TO GET THE REST OF THE CREW SO THAT WE COULD DIG UP 2"" MAIN AND TRY TO FIND WHERE GAS LEAK MIGHT BE.  LINE WAS DUG 2' TO 3' BACK TO MAIN AND FOUND WHERE 2"" P.V.C. PIPE HAD BEEN TAPPED TO 1 1/2"" P.V.C. MAIN AND THAT ITHAD BROKEN LOOSE.  WE PLUGGED LINE AND SECURED AREA FOR THE NIGHT.  LEFT AT ABOUT 1:00AM 1:15A.M., FEBRUARY 12, 1992, I CALLED ALBINO ZUNIGA WITH THE STATE CORPORATION COMMISSION AND ADVISED OF THE INCIDENT.  I TOLD HIM, AT THE TIME, I FELT THE HOUSE IN QUESTION WAS VALUED AT LESS THAN &50,000 AND THERE WERE NOT ANY INJURIES. HE ADVISED ME HE WOULD COME TO RATON AND WOULD BE OKAY IF WE COULD START REPAIR OF LINE AND RESTORE SERVICE TO THE AREA.  HE AGREED THAT WE SHOULD; BUT, TO KEEP AS MUCH OF THE DAMAGED PIPE AS POSSIBLE FOR CAUSEOF PROBLEM.  FEBRUARY 12, IN THE A.M. LARRY MARTINEZ AND CREW STARTED REPAIRIING LINE.  NEW CONNECTIONS WERE MADE TO 1 1/2"" LINE AND REATTACHED 2"" AND VALVE TO MAIN ON OAK STREET.  A PRESSURE TEST WAS APPLIED WITH AN AIR COMPRESSOR.  LINE WOULD NOT HOLD PRESSURE. UPON FURTHER CHECKING OF LINE, THEY FOUND THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER BREAK ON 2"" LINE ABOUT 30' FROM 1 1/2"" MIAN.  2"" LINE WAS SEPARATED AT A COUPLING WHICH HAD BROKEN IN HALF AND THERE WAS ABOUT 4 TO 6"" SEPARATON BETWEEN THE TWO BROKEN PARTS.  PE PIPE WAS INSTALLED AND A PRESSURE TEST WAS AGAIN APPLIED TO 60P.S.I., PRESSURE HELD.  UNITS (TRAILERS) WERERELIT AT ABOUT 3:00 P.M.  I FEEL SURE THAT WHAT CAUSED THE ESCAPE OF GAS LATER THAT NIGHT, WAS THAT THE LINE WAS BROKEN AGAIN.  AFTER THE OWNER FINISHED REPAIRINF SEWER LINE AND BACK-FILLED DITCH.  THIS IS WHEN 2ND AND 3RD BREAK OCCURRED."

THE GAS MIGRATED INTO THE BUILDING THROUGH A STRIP OF SANDY SOIL CONTAININGSEVERAL DRAINAGE CONDUCTS AND WAS IGNITED BY AN UNKNOWN SOURCE.""  CENTRALHUDSON IS IN THE PROCESS OF ANALYZING THE RELEVANT FACTS.  ATTHIS TIME, CENTRALHUDSON BELIEVES THAT THE CAUSE OF THE EXPLOSION IS UNDETERMINED.  IT ISUNDISPUTED THAT THERE WAS A CRACK IN THE 4-INCH CAST IRON GAS MAIN ON NOVEMBER 6, 1992, AND THAT GAS WAS ESCAPING FROM THE MAIN.  IT IS UNDETERMINED WHEN THE CRACK OCCURRED OR HOW MUCH GAS WAS ESCAPING.  THE STRIP OF ""SANDY"" SOIL REFERRED TO BY STAFF IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE SOILS TESTING PERFORMED BY BLASLAND & BOUCK ENGINEER. ALL OF THE SOILS TESTED TO THE EAST OF THE CRACKEDMAIN IN THE AREA BETWEEN 30 AND 26 LIBERTY ST. HAVE HIGH VOID CONTENTS AND WOULD HAVE ALLOWED UPWARD MIGRATION OF NATURAL GAS AS OPPOSED TO THE UNNATURAL55-FOOT HORIZONTAL MIGRATION, WHICH IS ASSUMED BY THE STAFF. CENTRAL HUDSONIS STUDYING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, WHETHER THERE WAS SUFFICIENT GAS IN THE AREATO HAVE CAUSED THE EXPLOSION.  THE MAIN WAS BEING OPERATED AT THE LOW PRESSURE OF APPROX. 1/4 PSI. MOREOVER, THE BAR HOLE READING NEAR 26 LIBERTY STREET APPEAR TO INDICATE QUANTITIES OF GAS THAT, WHEN DILUTED WITH BASEMENT AIR, WOULD HAVE BEEN INSUFFICIENT TO HAVE CAUSED AN EXPLOSION IN THE BASEMENT, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE HIGH VOID CONTENT OF THE SOIL AND THE MUCH LARGER VOLUME OF AIR WITHIN THE BASEMENT AS COMPARED TO THE SOIL."

THE FAILURE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FACTORSTHE PIPE IN QUESTION WAS INSTALLED IN JUNE 1974 IN ROCK-FREE, SANDY SOIL.  THERE IS NO RECORD OF LEAKS IN THE AREA WHERE THE FAILURE OCCURRED.  IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE FAILURE WAS LOCATED ON THE PIPE, JUST ALONG SIDE THE SOCKET FUSION.  THE CRACK IN THE PIPE APPEARED ALONG THE SURFACE OF THE MAIN, AT HE FACE OF THE TEE.  IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE MAIN GOING INTO ONE LEG OF THE TEE.  IT WAS ALSO NOTED THAT THE MAIN GOING INTO ONE LEG OF THE TEE, WAS AT A SLIGHT ANGLE.  THIS MAY HAVE PLACED UNNECESSARY STRESS ON THE PIPE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE MATERIAL FAILURE.  A SECOND FACTOR THAT MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FAILURE WAS THE FROST.  IN THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT, FROST USUALLY EXTENS 4-5' BELOW GRADE.  IN THIS CASE, HOWEVER, THE FROST EXTENDED TO A GREATERDEPTH BECAUSE THE TEE WAS BENEATH A PARKING LOT.  THE INSULATING BENEFIT OF THE SNOW IF REMOVED EACH TIME THE LOT IS CLEARED OF SNOW.  THE ADDITIONAL GROUND MOVEMENT CAUSED BY THE FROST/THAW CYCLE MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED ADDITIONAL STRESS TO THE PIPELINE.  FINALLY, RECENT THIRD PARTY EXCAVATION IN THE VICINITY OF THE PIPE, MAY HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE MATERIAL FAILURE.  ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE PIPE, A NEW SEWER LATERAL WAS INSTALLED BENEATH THE EXISTING PIPELINE, IN NOVEMBER 1992.  THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE LATERAL CANNOT BE DETERMINED BUT, IT IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE BREAK.  IMPROPER BACKFILLING PROCEDURES MAY HAVE CAUSED DELAYED SETTLING IN THE TRENCH AFTER THE WORK WAS COMPLETED, THUS CONTRIBUTING TO ADDITIONAL STRESS AND SUBSEQUENT FAILURE.  BASED UPON THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK AND THE SIZE OF THE MAIN, THE PRESENCE OF AN EXCESS FLOW VALVE WOULD HAVE HAD NO EFFECT NO PREVENTING THIS INCIDENT FROM OCCURRING."

I RESPONDED TO A BUILDING FIRE, WHICH WAS REPORTED TO HAVE HAD A BURN VICTIM INVOLVED.  UPON MY ARRIVAL, FIRE FIGHTERS SHOWED ME WHERE THE FIRE APPARENTLY ORIGINATED.  THERE WAS A GAS HEATERLOCATED ABOVE THE ENTRANCE WAY OF THE NIGHTCLUB ON A LANDING.  APPARENTLY, AFIRE HAD STARTED THERE AND SPREAD DOWN THE WEST SIDE WALL BURNING SOME BLACKTYPE PAPER THAT WAS OVER THE WINDOWS.  THE VICTIM HAD BEEN BURNED IN THIS AREA AND FALLEN TO THE FLOOR.  AFTER I THEN INVESTIGATED THE AREA WHERE I BELIEVE THE FIRE TO HAVE STARTED, I SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME FLASH-LIKE CHARRING ALL AROUND WHERE THE CUTOFF VALVE WAS LOCATED.  THERE WAS SOME BURNT PAPER AND/OR RAGS IN THIS AREA.  FIRE FIGHTERS STARTED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS FIRE WASAPPARENTLY ATTEMPTING TO TURN THE GAS OFF.  I THEN LEFT AND WENT TO LSU BURNCENTER TO TALK TO MR. ROBERT HALL, DATE OF BIRTH 9/13/52, WHO LIVES AT 2348 MARION STREET. MR. HALL STATED THAT HE WAS TRYING TO TURN THE GAS OFF, BECAUSE WHEN HE AND HIS COUSIN, ANGELA MAXIE ARRIVED AT THE CLUB, THE WHOLE BUILDING WAS FILLED WITH THE ODOR OF NATURAL GAS.  HE STATED THAT THEY OPENED THE DOORS TO ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE GAS ODOR.  AT THIS POINT, THEY HEARD A HISSING SSOUND COMING FROM THE AREA OF THE HEATER ABOVE THEE DOOR.  HE THEN GOT A LADDER, PUT IT UP, AND WENT UP TO INVESTIGATE.  HE SAW WHERE THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM, AND ASKED ANGELA TO THROW UP A WRENCH TO HIM.  SHE DID, AND AS HE ATTEMPTED TO TURN THE VALVE OFF, A FLASH ENSUED AND BURNED HIM ABOUT THE FACE AND HANDS.  I THEN QUESTIONED MS. ANGELA MAXIE, DATE OF BIRTH 12/28/67, WHO LIVESAT 2360 MARION STREET.  SHE STATED BASICALLY THE SAME THING.  SHE STATED THAT AS THEY WALKED INTO THE CLUB, THE STRONG ODOR OF NATURAL GAS COULD BE SMELLED.  SHE STATED SHE THREW UP A WRENCH TO MR. HALL, AND AS HE WENT TO TURN THEVALVE OFF, A BIG FLASH OF FIRE OCCURRED.  SHE STATED THAT HE FELL FROM THE LANDING, WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 12 FEET HIGH FROM THE FLOOR.  SHE THEN DOUSED HIM WITH WATER AND PATTED OUT THE FIRE AND THEN CALLED 911 TO GET HELP.  THE NATURE OF THIS FIRE IS ACCIDENTAL, AND THE CAUSE IS A GAS LEAK, WHICH WAS POSSIBLY IGNITED BY THE ELECTRIC STARTED ON THE GAS POWERED HEATER IN THENIGHTCLUB.  THIS CASE IS CLOSED.  MR.  ROBERT HALL WAS TAKEN TO LSU BURN UNIT WHERE HE IS NOW SUFFERING FROM FIRST AND SECOND DEGREE BURNS TO THE FACE AND HANDS.  NONE OF THE INJURIES SEEM TO BE LIFE THREATENING AT THIS TIME."

WHEN CPW PERSONNEL ARRIVED AT THE SCENE, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD PUT THE FIRE OUT AND FIRE FIGHTERS WERE HOSING DOWN THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER INVOLVED. THERE WERE TWO,1/2 INCH POLYETHYLENE PLASTICGAS LINES EXPOSED IN A DITCH LINE THAT WAS UNCOVERED. NATURAL GAS WAS BLOWINGFROM ON OF THE LINES. WITH THE FIRE DEPARTMENT STILL SPRAYING WATER ON THE LINES, OUR SERVICE WORKERS PROCEEDED TO  PINCH-OFF BOTH LINES. AFTER BOTH LINES WERE PINCHED-OFF, OUR CONSTRUCTION CREW ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND WERE TOLD TO KILL THE GAS SERVICE LINES BY RAY CRAFT. SINCE THIS INCIDENT FALLS UNDER PART 191.5 OF THE PIPELINE SAFETY REGULATIONS, TELEPHONIC NOTICE WAS GIVEN AT THE EARLIEST PRACTICABEL MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, WASHINGTON, DC. ALSO, A WRITTEN REPORT FORM RSPA F1700.1 WILL BE SUBMITTED WHEN ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONIS OBTAINED. ON SEPTEMBER 16, 1993, I INSTRUCTED THE CONSTRUCTION CREW TO REROUTE THE GAS LINES THAT WERE KILLED BECAUSE:(1) THEY WERE SERVING TWO OTHER CUSTOMERS AND (2) MR. WILLIAMS (THE OWNER OF THE TRAILER PARK) HAD MOVED A TRAILER OVER THE GAS LINES. I ALSO TOLD THE CONSTRUCITON CREW TO CUT-OUT THE LINE THAT WAS EXPOSED IN THE DITCH LINE. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 1993, MR. CARL MORSE OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION VISITED THE CPW TO ASSIST ME IN INSPECTING THE INCIDENT. WE SITE OF THE INCIDENT. MR. MORSE ADVISED US TO PRESSURE TEST THE SEGMENTS OF PIPES THAT WERE STILL IN THE GROUND, TO GET A COPY OF THE FIREDEPARTMENT REPORT, AND TO CHECK ANY LEAK REPORTS AND ANY LEAK SURVEYS THAT WERE CONDUCTED. WHILE WE WERE AT THE SCENE, MR. WILLIAMS ARRIVED. HE GAVE US HIS SON'S DETAILS OF THE INCIDENTS. ACCORDING TO MR. WILLIAMS, HIS SON WAS SETTING UP THE TRAILER. HE HAD SMELLED NATURAL GAS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT HE DID NOT CALL US. HE SAID THE GAS FUMES HAD EVEN MADE HIM SICK AT TIMES. HE SAID THAT HE EVEN WENT INTO THE STORE AND GOT SOME SOAP BUBBLES AND SOAPED THE EXPOSED LINES. HE ALSO ADDED THAT HIS SON SAW THE DIRT BLOWING. THE HE PROCEEDED TO GO BACK TO WORK, AND WHILE DRIVING A WEDGE TO SET UP THE TRAILER, HE CAUSED A SPARKS WHICH IGNITED THE GAS AND CAUSING THE FIRE. I TOLD MR. WILLIAMS THAT WE WERE CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION, THAT WE WERE GOING TO DIG UP THE LINESAND PRESSURE TEST THEM, AND THAT I WOULD LET HIM KNOW WHEN WE WERE GOINGTO DO THIS. ON SEPTEMBER 21, 1993, WITH MR. WILLIAMS AND HIS SON PRESENT, WETESTED THE LINES. MR. WILLIAMS SON SAID HE SAW DIRT BLOWING FROM UNDERNEATH THE SIDE OF THE TRAILER. WE TESTED THREE, 1/2 INCH LINES UNDER THE TRAILER'S SIDE AND FOUND NO LEAKS. ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE TRAILER, WE DUG UP THE LINESAND ONLY FOUND ONE 1/2 INCH LINE, TESTED IT, AND FOUND NO LEAK. WE ALSO FOUNDAN OLD CAP THAT MAY HAVE BEEN USED TO CAP-OFF THE OTHER LINE. WHILE DIGGING WE DID FIND VERY HARD DRY DIRT WITH AN ODOR TO IT THAD SMELLED OF GAS. THIS GENERALLY THE KIND OF CONDITIONS WE FIND AT LEAKS."

INVESTIGATION OF THE GAS LEAK DISCOVERED A 6"" CAST IRON MAIN AHD SUSTAINED A CIRCUMFERENTIAL BREAK IN FRONT OF 3149 ARAMINGO AVENUE IN THE ROADWAY, 3'6"" WEST OF THE EAST CURB OF ARAMINGO AVENUE AND 406'6"" SOUTH OF THE SUTH CURB OF ALLEGHENY AVENUE. THE BREAK WAS 21""6"" FROM THE FRONT FONDATION WALL OF 3149, APPROXIMATELY 4"" FROM THE PARTY LINE OF 3147 ARAMINGO AVENUE. THE BREAK IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN CAUSEDBY STRAIN INDUCED FROM SEWER REPAIR OPERATIONS TO A SEWER LATERAL THAT WAS RECENTLY INSTALLED UNDER THE GAS MAIN, EVIDENCED BY NEW PAVING (CONCRETE) WHEREBELGIUM BLOCK UNDER ASPHALT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. OBSERVATION OF 6"" OF FROST BELOW THE OPENING WAS ALSO OBSERVED AT THE TIME OF EXCAVATION WHICH IS BELIEVED TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE BREAK. IT IS THOUGHT THAT THE GS FROMTHE LOWER PRESSURE 6"" GAS MAIN THEN MIGRATED ALONG THE SOFT TRENCH OF THE SEWER LATERAL, ENTERED THE BASEMENT OF 3149 THROUGH THE FRONT FOUNDATION WALL.

ONE PERSON, A 50 YEAR OLD MALE, WAS IN THE RESIDENCE AT THE TIMEOF THE EXPLOSION AND HE SUSTAINED INJURIES THAT REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION. AT7:27 A.M., A SECOND EXPLOSION AND FIRE OCCURRED AT AN AUTO BODY SHOP ON 33MARKET STREET, WHICH IS LOCATED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE RESIDENCE.ALTHOUGH PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED, NO INJURIES RESULTED IN THIS SECONDEXPLOSION. THE OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY, DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION WASTELEPHONICALLY NOTIFIED OF THIS INCIDENT AT 8:20 A.M. ON 02/12/1994. CENTRALHUDSON AND THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION ARE CONDUCTINGINDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT. THERESIDENCE AND AUTO BODY SHOP INVOLVED IN THIS INCIDENT DID NOT HAVE NATURALGAS SERVICE. THE RESIDENCE AND THE AUTO BODY SHOP REVEALED THE EXISTENCE OFA CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK IN THE HEAT AFFECTED AREA ADJACENT TO A WELD. DURINGTHE INVESTIGATION, IT WAS NOTED THAT THE PIPE WAS BURIED 4 FEET DEEP AND,FURTHER, THAT FROST HAD PENETRATED TO THIS DEPTH. IT WAS ALSO OBSERVED THATTHERE WAS A SLIGHT INDENTATION ON THE TOP OF THE MAIN NEAR THE CRACK. THISINDENTATION EXISTED PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. INTERVIEWS AND OBSERVATIONS AT THESITE ALSO UNCOVERED THE FACT THAT SEWER EXCAVATION WORK HAD BEEN PERFORMED INTHE VICINITY OF THE CRACK LOCATION NINE MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT. THEREMOVED PORTION OF THE STEEL MAIN AND AIR SAMPLES TAKEN IN THE VICINITY OF THEINCIDENT ARE BEING ANALYZED BY INDEPENDENT LABORATORIES TO AID IN DETERMININGTHE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT. CENTRAL HUDSON IS FULLY COOPERATING WITH THEINVESTIGATION OF THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE. SUPPLEMENTALREPORT 12/22/94 INDICATED THE FOLLOWING: CENTRAL HUDSON GAS & ELECTRICCORPORATION (""CENTRAL HUDSON"" OR ""THE COMPANY"") AND THE ENERGY AND WATERDIVISION (""PSC STAFF"") SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLICSERVICE COMMISSION (""PSC""), CONDUCTED INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS OF THISINCIDENT, WHICH OCCURRED IN THE VILLAGE OF WAPPINGERS FALLS, NEW YORK, ONFEBRUARY 12, 1994 IN THE COMPANY'S SERVICE TERRITORY. THE INCIDENT INVOLVED ANEXPLOSION AND FIRE AT A RESIDENCE AND, A SHORT TIME LATER, AN EXPLOSION ANDFIRE AT A NEARBY COMMERCIAL BUILDING. FOLLOWING THIS INCIDENT, THE COMPANY,IN AGREEMENT WITH THE PSC STAFF, DEVELOPED A PLAN TO ASSESS THE INTEGRITY OFTHE PN LINE TO DETERMINE IF ADDITIONAL MEASURES WERE NECESSARY TO ENHANCE THESAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE LINE. SUCH PLAN COMMITS THE COMPANY TO: (1)REPLACE A CERTAIN SECTION OF THE PN LINE, (2) SURVEY THE PN LINE IN THEVILLAGE OF WAPPINGERS FALLS MONTHLY THROUGHOUT THE 1994-95 HEATING SEASON, (3)DEVELOP AN ENHANCED GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE PLAN AND (4) DEVELOP A GAS SYSTEMEMERGENCY VALVING PLAN AND SCHEDULE. BY REPORT DATED OCTOBER 25, 1994, THE PSCSTAFF ACCEPTED THE COMPANY'S PLAN. THE REPORT WAS ACCEPTED BY THE PSC ONNOVEMBER 9, 1994 AND RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY ON NOVEMBER 10, 1994. THE REPORTCONCLUDES THAT THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT WAS AN IGNITION OF GAS THATACCUMULATED IN EACH OF THE STRUCTURES AFTER MIGRATING THROUGH THE GROUND FROMA LEAK IN CENTRAL HUDSON'S HAS MAIN IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE TWO DESTROYEDBUILDINGS.

LEAKING GAS THEN BEGAN TO BURN ACROSS THE WIDTH OF THE STREET AS IT ESCAPED THROUGH CRACKS IN THE PAVEMENT. AIR TEMPERATURE AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 0 DEGREES F. THE GROUND WAS COVERED BY APPROXIMATELY ONE INCH OF ICE AND FOUR INCHES OF SNOW WHICH FELL THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 17. THE GAS WAS SHUT OFF TO 19 HOUSES IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY WHERE GAS WAS DETECTED. AN ADDITIONAL 258 HOUSES WERE EVACUATED. THE LEAKING 2"" STEEL MAIN WAS A TWO-WAY FEED. THE GAS WAS STOPPED OFF ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LEAK AT 6:00 P.M. APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET TO THE NORTH OF THE LEAK, THE 2"" MAINTIED INTO A 6"" DISTRIBUTION MAIN (PRIMARY FEED). GAS WAS LEAKING THROUGH THEGROUND INTO THE HOLE DUG AT THE 6"" MAIN TO INSTALL A FITTING. WKG WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT DIGGING OTHER HOLES TO VENT THE LEAKING, BURNING GAS AND MAKE THE SECOND SHUTDOWN HOLE ACCESSIBLE. ALL EVACUATED HOUSED WERE TURNED OFF BY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT ON ORDERS OF THE ASSISTANT FIRE CHIEF. THE BLOWING GAS WAS STOPPED AT 7:45 AM CST BY PLUGGING THE SECOND STOPPER FITTING NEAR THE 6"" MAIN. RESTORATION OF SERVICE TO THE 277 CUSTOMERS TURNED OFF, BEGAN AT 2:00 PMCST AND WAS COMPLETED BY 11:30 PM CST ON JANUARY 20, EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST 12CUSTOMERS SHUT DOWN. ON MONDAY JANUARY 24, THE MAIN WAS EXCAVATED TO DETERMINE THE SOURCE AND CAUSE OF THE LEAK. IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE 2"" STEEL GAS MAIN HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DAMAGED BY A THIRD PARTY. THERE WERE ALSO INDICATIONS THAT THE TRENCH HAD SETTLED AND THE STREET HAD BEEN REPAIRED AT SOME LATER DATE. THE EXCAVATION REVEALED A CAVITY UNDER THE CONCRETE SUB-BASE, LEAVING THE PIPE UNSUPPORTED BY BACKFILL. LABORATORY TESTS REVEALED THAT THE MAIN SUFFERED BRITTLE FRACTURE DUE TO STRESS CONCENTRATION CAUSED BY DAMAGE BY EXTERENAL FORCES, AND THE REDUCED DUCTILITY OF THE PIPE DUE TO THE LOW TEMPERATURES AT THE TIME OF FAILURE. NEW MAIN AND SERVICES WERE RUN IN W. 15TH STREET AND THE REMAINING SEVEN HOMES WERE TURNED BACK ON JANUARY 27, 1994."

THE GAS METER AND REGULATOR WERE REMOVED BY NJNG PERSONNEL AND DELIVERED TO PETER VALLAS ASSOCIATES, INC. OF 125 STAT STREET, HACKENSACK, NJ 07601 FOR TESTING. SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS HAD RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF ""NO HEAT"" COMPLAINTS IN OUR SERVICE TERRITORY CAUSED BY ICE COVERING THE OUTSIDE METERS. NJNG WANTED TO ASSURE THAT THE SUSPECTED ICING CONDITION OF THIS METER DID NOT IN ANY WAY CAUSE THE INCIDENT. THE OCCUPANT OF THIS HOUSE, MR. WILLIAM HAHN, HAD CALLED IN A COMPLAINT OF ""NO GAS"" AT 6:18 P.M. THE PREVIOUS EVENING. HE REPORTED THAT HIS ELECTRICITY HAD ALSO BEEN OFF BUT WAS NOW BACK ON.THE FAMILY THEN LEFT TO SPEND THE NIGHT AT A NEARBY HOTEL. THE FOLLOWING DAY, THE SERVICE WAS EXCAVATED AT THE MAIN CONNECTION AND PRESSURE TESTED. THE SERVICE HEALD SYSTEM PRESSUE: 39.5 PSIG AND WAS THEN TESTED WITH AIR AT 100 PSIG FOR 10 MINUTES. AGAIN, THE PRESSURE HELD. THE .5"" DIAMETER X-TRUBE SERVICEWAS EXAMINED IN THE EXCAVATION AND FOUND TO BE IN GOOD CONDITION. THE MAINTENANCE ORDER IS ATTACHED. ARTHUR L. JACKSON, CHIEF INVESTIGATOR FOR PETER VALLAS ASSOCIATES, INC., HAS REPORTED VERBALLY THAT WHILE THE METER AND REGULATORWERE DAMAGED BY THE FIRE, THEY COULD FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY FAILURE OF OUR FACILITIES OCCURRED WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS ACCIDENT.

A GAS FIRE ERUPTEDDURING A SQUEEZE OFF OPERATION ON A 6INCH PLASTIC MAIN; THE MAIN WAS LEAKINGDUE TO BREAKAGE OF A PLASTIC FUSION JOINT. THE ENSUING FIRE CAUSEDSECOND-DEGREE BURNS TO TWO EMPLOYEES AND SOME PROPERTY DAMAGE. THE TWO INJUREDEMPLOYEES RECEIVED MEDICAL TREATMENT AT THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM AND WERERELEASED. ONE EMPLOYEE'S BURNS WERE TO THE BACK OF HIS HANDS, RESULTING IN TWOWEEKS OF RECUPERATION. THE OTHER INJURED EMPLOYEES HAD NO LOST TIME.  THEINTERIOR OF THE BACKHOE, WHICH WAS ON THE JOB SITE, BURNED; THE TELEPHONE ANDELECTRIC WIRES WERE BURNED DOWN. THIS, ALONG WITH THE LOSS OF GAS AND CLAIMSRECEIVED DUE TO A LOSS OF BUSINESS RESULTING FROM BEING SHUT OFF DURING THEREPAIRS, WAS THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE.  NIAGARA MOHAWK INVESTIGATED THEINCIDENT IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER: COLLECTION OF EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE - THISINCLUDED THE COLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE ALONG WITHPHOTOS, VIDEOS, AND OTHER DOCUMENTATION DEEMED NECESSARY FOR INVESTIGATION.INITIAL AND FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS- THE INITIAL INTERVIEWS WITH THE CREW WEREHELD ON A ONE-ON-ONE BASIS, ALONG WITH INTERVIEWS WITH THE SERVICEREPRESENTATIVES THAT INVESTIGATED AND ASSISTED IN THE GAS LEAK AND ENSUINGFIRE. FAILURE MODE INVESTIGATION - THIS WAS DONE TO IDENTIFY THE PHYSICALATTRIBUTES THAT LED TO COMPONENT FAILURE. THIS INCLUDED EXAMINING OUR EXISTINGSTANDARD PROCEDURES, ALONG WITH THE PLASTIC PIPE MANUFACTURER'S REPRESENTATIVEEXAMINING THE FAILED FUSION JOINT.  OTHER GROUPS INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATION -REPRESENTATIVES FROM SYSTEM GAS OPERATIONS, SYSTEM GAS ENGINEERING, SYSTEMTRAINING, SAFETY, AND CENTRAL REGION OPERATIONS ASSISTED IN AN OUTSIDEEVALUATION OF THE INCIDENT. BURNETT POWELL JR, TECHNICAL SERVICES REPR., OFPHILLIPS DRISCOPIPE INC. EVALUATED THE FUSION JOINT THAT FAILED. CAUSE OF THEINCIDENT - THE MOST PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT, AS RECONSTRUCTED FROM THEINVESTIGATION PERFORMED, WAS THAT THE STATIC ELECTRICITY BUILT UP DURING THESQUEEZE OFF OPERATION AND IGNITED THE GAS LEAKING FROM THE PLASTIC FUSED JOINTTHAT FAILED.  ROOT CAUSE - POOR JUDGMENT WAS USED IN  PLACEMENT OF THESQUEEZE-OFF TOOL; IT WAS TOO CLOSE TO A GAS LEAK. NO PROVISIONS WERE MADE TODISSIPATE THE STATIC CHARGE. THE SAFETY ASPECTS OF WHAT COULD HAPPEND WERE NOTCONSIDERED PRIOR TO THIS OPERATION. ACTIONS TO PREVENT REOCCURENCES: ALLSQUEEZE-OFF TOOLS ARE NOW EQUIPPED AND PERSONNEL HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO INSTALLGROUNDING KITS ON ALL SQUEEZE-OFF EQUIPMENT. PLASTIC PIPE TO BE SQUEEZED OFF,ALONG WITH TIE-IN OF PLASTIC PIPE, WILL BE SPRAYED WITH A SOAPY WATER SOLUTIONTO ASSIST IN DISSIPATING THE STATIC CHARGE ON THE PIPE. THE TIE-IN FUSE THATFAILED WAS MADE WITH THE OVERBEND METHOD; THIS METHOD WILL ONLY BE USED IFCONDITIONS ARE IDEAL. ALL 6"" FUSES MADE BY THIS METHOD IN THIS DISTRICT WILLBE EXCAVATED AND EVALUATED FOR PROPER MELT. A 6"" COUPLING WILL BE PLACED OVERTHESE FUSES TO PREVENT REOCCURENCES OF THIS TYPE OF GAS LEAK. A VIDEO ONSTATIC ELECTRICITY WILL BE SHOWN TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE CREWS PLUS SUPERVISIONTO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS SUBJECT. THE CREW CHIEF AND THE SUPERVISORON THE JOB SITE WERE REPRIMANDED FOR THE USE OF POOR JUDGMENT. THIS CREW ANDTHE SUPERVISOR ARE NOW HOLDING SAFETY MEETINGS WITH ALL GAS PERSONNEL IN THEREGION TO EXPLAIN THE INCIDENT AND HOW THEY FELT IT COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED."

ON FEBRUARY 10, 1994, NEW JERSEY NATURAL GASCOMPANY (NJNG) RECEIVED A TELEPHONE REPORT OF AN EXPLOSION FROM THE SHIPBOTTOMPLOICE DEPARTMENT. AN NJNG SERVICEMAN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 3:30 A.M.AND FOUND THE BUILDING DESTROYED AND A SMALL, CONTROLLED FIRE BURNING IN THEKITCHEN AREA. FIRE AND POLICE PERSONNEL WERE AT THE SCENE BUT HAD NOT SHUT OFFTHE GAS. THE OUTSIDE METER SET WAS BLOCKED BY DEBRIS AND THE CURB VALVE BOXWAS COVERED BY ICE AND SNOW. ADDITIONAL NJNG PERSONNEL WERE DISPATCHED TO THESITE AND THE OTHER BUILDINGS IN THE AREA WERE CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF GASWITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR. ALL MAINS AND SERVICES UNIT. AT 6: A.M., ASINGLE LEAK WAS LOCATED. THIS LEAK WAS ON THE SERVICE RISER AT #2005PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE AND COULD NOT HAVE CONTRIBUTIED TO THE EXPLOSION. NO OTHERLEAKS WERE FOUND  AND NO INDICATION OF GAS WAS FOUND IN ANY NEARBY BUILDINGS.THE 3/4"" STEEL SERVICE LINE OT #2041 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WAS RETIRED ATAPPROXIMATELY 7:20 A.M. AND PRESSURE TESTED WITH AIR AT THE CURRENT OPERATINGPRESSURE, 54 PSIG, FOR 20 MINUTES. THE LINE HELD THE PRESSURE. THIS SERVICELINE AND 2"" STEEL GAS MAIN IN PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE WERE EXAMINED AND FOUND TOBE IN GOOD CONDITION. COPIES OF THE MAINTANANCE ORDERS FOR THE PRESSURE TESTAND MAIN CONDITION REPORT ARE ATTACHED. THE METER BUILD-UP AND SERVICEREGULATOR WERE EXAMINED AND FOUND TO BE INTACT. THEY WERE REMOVED BY NJNG ANDHELD IN STORAGE PENDING RECEIPT OF THE FIRE MARSHAL'S REPORT WHICH IS ALSOATTACHED. THE FIRE MARSHAL'S REPORT CONCLUDES THAT THE EXPLOSION OCCURRED INTHE KITCHEN AREA WHERE THE STOVE AND WATER HEATER WERE LOCATED. THIS ISCONSISTENT WITH NJNJG'S CONCLUSION THAT OUR FACILITIES WERE NOT INVOLVED INTHE INCIDENT.AT APPROXIMATELY 1:45 PM ON THURSDAY, 01/13/94, A FIRE ERUPTED IN TRENCH S/CH 1 CONTINUATION OT HOUSES 19 AND 20. THE FIRE WAS QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED AND THERE WAS NO INJURY OR SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE. THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BY ONE OF THE LABORERS USING A PROPANE TORCH TO APPLY THE HEAT SHRINK TO THE SEWER TIE-IN. THIS REQUIRES SOME EXPLANATION. ALL OF THE UTILITIES IN THE 21 - UNIT HOUSING(SEWER, WATER AND GAS) RUN IN THE SAME TRENCH (SEE 12/21 HOUSING SERVICE CONNECTIONS, SHEET C6, DETAIL 7). OFTEN IN THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION, A GIVEN TRENCH MAY NOT BE COMPLETED IN ONE CONTINUOUS TIME SPAN. OFTEN THE UTILITIES ARE COMPLETED IN SEGMENTS. WHEN THIS OCCURS, THE UTILITIES ARE STUBBED-OUT (IE: CAPPED OFF) AND BURIED. WHEN THE REMAINING WORK IS TO BE DONE, THE STUBS ARE EXPOSED AND THE REST OF THE UTILITY LINES ARE THEN TIED INTO THE EXISTING LINES. THE WORK THAT WAS IN PROGRESS AT THE TIME OF IGNITION WAS THE PLACING OF THE HEAT SHRINK AT THE SEWERLINE TIE-IN. AS SHOWN IN THE ABOVE REFERENCED DRAWING, THE GAS LINE IS IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE OTHER LINES IN THE TRENCH. THE LABORER WHO WAS PERFORMING THE HEAT SHRINK WORK (FOREST AHKIVIANA) HAD NOT PLACED ANY HEAT SHIELDING OVER THE GAS LINE. SINCE THE GAS LINE IN THIS AREA IS MADE OF HDPE (HIGH DENSITY POLYETHYLENE) THE FLAME FROM THE TORCH SOFTENED THE HDPE LINE. THE GAS DISTRIBUTION PRESSURE OF TWENTY POUNDS CAUSED THE SOFTENED PIPE TO RUPTURE AND THE GAS WAS THEN IGNITED BY THE TORCH. ONE OF THE WORKERS (BILLY ITTA) RAN TO A NEARBY VEHICLE (APPROXIMATELY 30 FEET AWAY) FOR A FIRE EXTINGUISHER AND QUICKLY EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE. I ESTIMATE THATTHE FIRE LASTED APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS. MEANWHILE, ANOTHER WORKER (MARK TYREE) HAD GOTTEN A CLAMP AND BEGUN TO SQUEEZE THE LINE CLOSED. BEFORE HE COULDACCOMPLISH THE TASK, A WORKER FROM BUECI (BARROW UTILITIES AND ELECTRIC COOPE"

HE SUSTAINED FIRST AND SECONDDEGREE BURNS TO HIS NOSE, HANDS, AND ARMS. THE SECOND CREWW MEMBER MR. WILLIAM MAUSER, EAST OHIO GAS TECHNICIAN, ASSISTED MR. UDOVIC OUT OF THE DITCH, ATTENDED IS IS BURNS, AND THEN EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE WITH A DRY CHEMICAL EXTINGUISHER. MR. MAUSER THEN PLUGGED THE OPENING, STOPPING THE FLOW OF GAS. AS A RESULT OF HIS INJURIES, MR. UDOVIC WAS ADMITTED TO EUCLID MERIDIA HOSPITAL FORADDITIONAL TREATMENT AND OBSERVATION. HE WAS RELEASED THE FOLLOWING DAY. UPON COMPLETION OF A THROUGH EXAMINATION OF THE WORK SITE AND AFTER INTERVIEWINGTHE TWO WORKERS, AN EXACT CAUSE OF THE FIRE COULD NOT BE DETERMINED. BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AT THE SCENE, IT IS SUSPECTED THAT THE IGNITION SOURCE OF THE FIRE WAS A SPARK CAUSED BY METAL TO METAL CONTACT IN THE COURSE OF THE DRIP REPLACEMENT. THERE WERE NO RUNNING VEHICLES NEAR THE WORK SITE DURING THE TIMETHE WORK WAS BEING COMPLETED, AND THE TORCH USED TO APPLY THE SHRINK SLEEVESHAD BEEN PLACED BACK ON THE TRUCK PRIOR TO THE LUNCH BREAK. AN ANODE WAS TO BE ATTACHED TO THE PIPE AFTER THIS JOB WAS COMPLETED, BUT NONE OF THE CADWELDEQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS WERE PRESENT NEAR THE DITCH AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. NEITHER OF THE WORKERS ON THIS CREW ARE SMOKERS.  AFTER MR. UDOVIC WAS TAKEN TO THE HOSPITAL, A SECOND WORK CREW ARRIVED TO ASSIST MR. MAUSER IN COMPLETING THE JOB. DUE TO DAMAGE SUSTAINED IN THE FIRE, THE SHRINK SLEEVES WERE REPLACE, AND REPLACEMENT OF THE DRIP WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT INCIDENT. IN ORDERTO MINIMIZE THE CHANCES OF A RECURRENCE, ALL PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN THIS TYPEOF WORK WILL BE MADE AWARE OF THE DETAILS OF THIS INCIDENTS."

THE LABORER HAD 3RD DEGREE BURNS TO THE ARMS AND LEGS.  HE WAS ADMITTED TO A HOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT OF THESE BURNS.THE BANKS OF THE EXCAVATION HAD BEEN CHECKED MINUTES PRIOR TO THE FIRE STARTING.  A READING OF FIVE (5) PERCENT LEL WAS OBTAINED UPSTREAM OF THE EXCAVATION.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS READING WAS RESIDUAL GAS FROM LEAK #1. NO GAS WAS DETECTED IN THE BANK (DOWNSTREAM) AT ANY TIME DURING THE REPAIR OF LEAK #1.AFTER FURTHER INVESTIGATION, IT APPEARS THAT A ""SCAB"" FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE8"" PIPE AT A POINT 18 FEET DOWNSTREAM OF LEAK #1 (LEAK #2) CAME OFF AT SOME TIME DURING THE REPAIR OF LEAK #1.  IGC BELIEVES THAT VIBRATION OF THE PIPE IN PREPARATION FOR THE INSTALLATION OF THE REINFORCING SLEEVE, AS WELL AS THE HEATING AND COOLING OF THE PIPE DURING THE WELDING PROCESS, MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE SCAB SEPARATING FROM THE PIPE.  IT IS IGC'S CONCLUSION THAT THE GASMIGRATED TO THE BELL HOLE FROM THE LOCATION OF LEAK #2, AND WAS IGNITED BY THE WELDING PROCESS."

THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SERVICES TO THE TOWNHOUSE COMPLEX HAD BEEN INSTALLED IN A COMMON TRENCH IN EARLY 1987. OPERATING PRESSURE IN THE GAS SERVICE LINE WAS 60 PSI. AMBIENT TEMPERATURE IN AFTERNOON OF AUGUST 17 WAS APPROXIMATELY 85 DEGREE F. AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT, AN RG&E EMPLOYEE WAS WORKING AT THE SITE TO REPAIR AN UNDERGROUND ELECTRIC CABLE (URD) FAULT. BOTH THE CABLE FAULT AND A BREAK IN THE GAS SERVICE TRACER WIRE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY LOCATED DURING A STAKE-OUT AND FOUND TO BE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF A FENCE POST. THE FENCE CONSISTED OF TWO SECTIONS (EACH APPROXIMATELY EIGHT FEET LONG) AND THREE POSTS WHICH HAD BEEN INSTALLED SOME TIME AFTER THE GAS AND ELECTRIC SERVICE WERE INSTALLED. AFTER THE FAULT WAS LOCATED, A TRENCH APPROXIMATELY 3 1/2' LONG X 1 1/2' DEEP WAS EXCAVATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE FENCE. THE ELECTRIC CABLES WERE FOUND BEHIND THE FENCE POST, ON THE WEST SIDE. THE FAULTED AREAS WERE CUT OUT IN PREPARTION FOR SPLICING IN NEW CABLE. DURING THE INSTALLATION OF HEAT SHRINK TUBING MATERIAL OVER THE FIRST COMPLETED CABLE SPLICE USING A PROPANE TORCH FLAME AS A SOURCE OF HEAT, THE EMPLOYEE WAS THROWN DIAGONALLY OUT OF THE TRENCH BY A SUDDEN BLAST AND LANDED ON HIS BACK. WHEN THEEMPLOYEE CLIMBED TO HIS FEET, HE NOTED THAT THE WOODEN FENCE WAS BEGINNING TO BURN AND HEARD A ""ROAR"". AFTER CALLING FOR HELP FROM HIS TRUCK, HE RETURNEDTO THE SCENE OF THE EXPLOSION, PICKED UP THE PROPANE TORCH (WHICH HE HAD CARRIED WITH HIM AS HE WAS THROWN OUT OF THE TRENCH AND WHICH,AT THIS POINT, WASBURNING) AND THREW IT AWAY FROM THE FIRE ONTO THE LAWN IN THE BACKYARD. HE RECALLED THAT THE FIRE HAD INCREASED IN INTENSITY AT THIS POINT. THE EMPLOYEE STATED REPEATEDLY DURING INTERVIEWS THAT HE NEITHER HEARD NOR SMELLED ESCAPING NATURAL GAS PRIOR TO THE EXPLOSION, NOR DID HE EVER SEE THE GAS SERVICE LINE.

THE METERING STATION NEAR ELGIN IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW NATURAL GAS TO FLOW FROM THE HIGH PRESSURE 6 INCH MAIN OF CITIZENS GAS INTO THE LOW PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM OF CITIZENS GAS IN THE ELGIN/HIGHWAY 52 AREA. FOR A DIAGRAM OF THEMETERING STATION, SEE EXHIBIT ""A"" ATTACHED. THE NATURAL GAS TRAVELS FROM THE6 INCH MAIN THROUGH A 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE, WHICH IS LOCATED ON TOP OF THE GROUND. THE NATURAL GAS THEN FLOWS VERTICALLY THROUGH A STEEL TRANSITION INTO 2 INCH DIAMETER STEEL PIPE. THE NATURAL GAS THEN FLOWS THROUGH A 90 DEGREE ELBOW AND THEN TRAVELS HORIZONTALLY THROUGH A 2 INCH NIPPLE WITH A GAUGE PORT, THROUGH A PRESSURE REGULATOR, THROUGH A 2 INCH NIPPLE WITH A GAUGE PORT, THROUGH A METER STOP VALVE, AND THROUGH A DIAPHRAGM METER. THE NATURAL GAS, UPON LEAVING THE METER, THEN FLOWS THROUGH A METER STOP VALVE, A CHECK VALVE, AND SAFETY RELIEF VALVE, THEN THROUGH A 90 DEGREE ELBOW DOWN VERTICALLY INTO PIPEBURIED UNDER THE GROUND. UPON ARRIVING AT THE SCENE, DARRYL CROSS AND DENNISGOAD APPARENTLY SHUT OFF THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE, PREVENTING GAS FLOW INTO THE METERING STATION. THE MEN THEN REMOVED THE REGULATOR AND INSPECTED IT FORICE FORMATION AND BLOCKAGE ON THE REGULATOR OFFICE. ONE OF THE MEN PLACED THE REGULATOR INSIDE ONE OF THE TRUCKS IN ORDER TO THAW THE ICE FORMED ON THE ORIFICE. ONE OF THE MEN THEN CONNECTED 2 INCH DIAMETER PIPE MEASURING APPROXIMATELY 30 INCHES IN LENGTH ONTO THE METER RUN WHERE THE REGULATOR WAS PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED. ON THE END OF THE 2 INCH DIAMETER PIPE, A 90 DEGREE ELBOW WAS ATTACHED, AND THEN A SHORT SECTION OF PLASTIC PIPE. THIS 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY WAS ATTACHED SO THAT THE ""L"" ASSEMBLY WAS PARALLEL TO THE GROUND. THE PIPE ASSEMBLY WAS ATTACHED IN ORDER TO DIVERT THE FLOW OF NATURAL GAS AWAY FROM A NEARBY HOUSE AND AWAY FROM THE OPERATOR OF THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE. DARRYL CROSS THEN POSITIONED HIMSELF OVER THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE AND PLACED A PIPE WRENCH ON THE VALVE STEM IN ORDER TO OPERATE THE VALVE. THE PROCEDURE INITIATEDBY MR. CROSS WAS USED TO ALLOW NATURAL GAS TO FLOW THROUGH THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE AND OUT THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY IN ORDER TO CLEAR THAT SECTION OF PIPE OF ANY OBSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS AN ICE FORMATION IN THE PIPE. UPON SO DOING AND UNFORESEEABLE SURGE OF NATURAL GAS FLOWED THROUGH THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE AND OUT THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY, CAUSING THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY TO SPIN OUT OF CONTROL. WHEREUPON, THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY HIT MR. CROSS IN THE HEAD, RENDERING HIM UNCONSCIOUS. THE 2 INCH PIPE ASSEMBLY THEN HIT DENNIS GOAD IN THE PELVIC AREA, KNOCKING HIM TO THE GROUND. TIM LOGGINS IMMEDIATELY SHUT OFF THE GAS FLOWING THROUGH THE 4 INCH FLANGED VALVE AND RENDERED FIRST AID TO THE INJURED EMPLOYEES. A NEIGHBOR SUMMONED THE AMBULANCE SERVICE AND THE SCOTT C OUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. DARRYL CROSS LATER DIED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE MEDICAL CENTER, NEVER HAVING REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.

INITIAL TESTS CONCERNING CORROSION OF PIPE HAVE INDICATED THAT CORROSION WAS NOT PRESENT. FURTHER TEST OF THIS PIECE OF PIPE WILL OCCUR IN THE NEAR FUTURE, WHEN PERMISSION IS GRANTED FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY OF THE HOMEOWNER, TO DESTRUCTIVELY TEST THIS PIECE OF PIPE. THESE TESTS WILL DETERMINE IF THE CRACK WAS CAUSED BY STRESS OR FATIGUE.  THE REMAINDER OF THE SERVICE LINE WAS TESTED IN TWO (2) DIFFERENT SECTIONS. THE FIRST SECTION TESTED WAS A 34' PIECE OF 1"" STEEL THAT ORIGINATED AT THE OUTLET OF THE CURB VALVE AND ENDED AT THE POINT WHERE THE ELBOW MENTIONED ABOVE WAS CUT OUT, THE SECOND SECTION WAS A 21"" PIECE OF 1"" STEEL RISER TO THE METER SET. TESTS INDICATED THAT BOTH PIECES OF THE PIPEWERE PRESSURE TIGHT AT APPROXIMATELY 20 PSIG FOR 15 MINUTES. AS INDICATED ABOVE, FINDINGS AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT HAVE NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. A SUPPLEMENTAL WEPORT WILL BE FILED AS CAUSE BECOMES KNOWN."

MERRILL GRAVEL & CONSTRUCTION HADCONTACTED DIGGERS HOTLINE ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS TO ARRANGE FOR UNDERGROUND FACILITIES TO BE LOCATED AND MARKED. THIS INCLUDED ONGOING RELOCATES AS THEPROJECT PROGRESSED. ON JULY 24, 1996, MERRILL GRAVEL & CONSTRUCTION COMPANY WAS EXCAVATING BELOW SUBGRADE TO REMOVE SOME UNDESIRABLE SOIL BACKFILL ON THEWEST SIDE OF SEVENTH STREET. THE EXCAVATION WAS MADE NEAR THE ALLEY ENTRANCEAT APPROX THE MIDDLE OF THE 300 BLOCK, BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON STREETS. AT APPROX 9:23 A.M., ANNIE MYER OF MERRILL GRAVEL & CONSTRUCTION NOTIFIED WISCONSIN FUEL & LIGHT CO (WF&L) THAT A STEEL GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN HOOKED IN THE 300 BLOCK OF SEVENTH STREET, WITH GAS LEAKING. WF&L RESPONDED BY DISPATCHING A CONTRACTOR REPRESENTATIVE, AN EMERGENCY REPAIR VEHICLE AND A TWO-PERSON CONSTRUCTION/CREW. AT APPROX 9:33 A.M., A WF&L EMPLOYEE AT THE SITE REPORTED BACK TO THE COMPANY'S RADIO DISPATCHER THAT THE 1 1/4"" STEEL SERVICE TO 620 WASHINGTON STREET HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY SQUEEZED OFF AND THE LEAK HAD BEEN CONTROLLED. (IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE HERE THAT ALTHOUGH THE TIME WHICH ELAPSEDBETWEEN THE NOTIFICATION OF THE DAMAGE TO WF&L AND CONTROL OF THE LEAK BY COMPANY PERSONNEL WAS ONLY 10 MINS., IT IS UNKNOWN HOW MUCH TIME PASSED BETWEENTHE POINT AT WHICH THE ACTUAL DAMAGE OCCURRED AND THE TIME AT WHICH WF&L WASNOTIFIED. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS DAMAGE OCCURRENCE. FIRST OF ALL, THE 1-1/4"" STEEL SERVICE INVOLVED HAD NOT BEEN MARKED BY THE WF&L REPRESENTATIVE IN THE FIELD. IN ADDITION, THE SERVICE WAS NOT SHOWN ON THE WORKING DRAWINGS BEING USED FOR THE STREET RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT BY THE CONTRACTOR. THIS IS BECAUSE THE SERVICE HAD INADVERTENTLY BEEN OMITTED WHEN THE GAS FACILITIES WERE MARKED ON THE PLANS WHICH HAD BEEN SUBMITTED TO THE WF&L DRAFTING DEPARTMENT BY THE RECONSTRUCTION PLANS FOR THE CONTRACTOR PRIOR TO THE PROJECT.THE SERVICE LATERAL WAS SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL, SINCE IT SERVED A BUILDING ON A STREET OTHER THAN THE ONE IN WHICH THE MAIN WAS LOCATED. THE SERVICE TO 620 WASHINGTON STREET, (FIGURE 1), RAN FROM A 6"" STEEL MAIN ON SEVENTH STREET, THEN WEST THROUGH THE ALLEY BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND JEFFERSON STREETS. WHEN THIS SERVICE WAS INSTALLED IN 1963, THE EXISTING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON WASHINGTON STREET COULD NOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE GAS SUPPLY FOR THE LAUNDROMAT THAT WAS LOCATED THERE. WHEN THE SERVICE LATERAL WAS HOOKED AND PULLED AT THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT, IT SEPARATED AT A COMPRESSION FITTING LOCATED AT THE ALLEY, ABOUTFIVE FEET WEST OF THE SEVENTH STREET RIGHT-OF-WAY. AT APPROX 9:38 A.M., AFTER THE DAMAGED SERVICE HAD BEEN PINCHED CLOSED AND WF&L PERSONNEL WERE EVALUATING THE EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE TO GAS FACILITIES, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED WITHIN THE VACANT SINGLE-FAMILY STRUCTURE AT 310 SEVENTH STREET. IT IS BELIEVED THATLEAKING GAS HAD MIGRATED UNDERGROUND FROM THE SEPARATED COMPRESSION FITTING AND PASSED THROUGH THE STONE AND CONCRETE BASEMENT WALL TO ENTER THE STRUCTURE. THERE WERE STANDING PILOT LIGHTS IN OPERATION FOR BOTH THE WATER HEATER AND THE FURNACE AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION. IT IS ASSUMED THAT ONE OF THESE APPLIANCE PROVIDED THE IGNITION SOURCE.  THE RESULTING BLAST AND FIRE DESTROYED THE VACANT HOME AND GARAGE AT 310 SEVENTH STREET. ADJACENT STRUCTURES AT 308 SEVENTH STREET AND 629 JEFFERSON STREET SUSTAINED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE AS WELL.

THE PLATES HAD BEEN OVER THE VALVE AND PART OF THE EXCAVATION FOR NEW PIPE. ON THURSDAY, AUGUST 1, 1996 AT APPROX 6:30AM I WAS ADVISED BY OUR DISPATCHER THAT HE HAD RECEIVED NUMEROUS PHONE CALLS FROM WEST SIDE RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS COMPLAINING OF NO GAS. WE DISPATCHED CREWS TO THE AREA AT APPROX 7:00 A.M., AND AT 7:15 A.M. I WAS ADVISED BY ONE OF OUR CREWS THAT A VALVE AT THE INTERSECTION OF CLEVELAND AVENUE AND N.W. WASHINGTON BLVD. HAD BLOWN OFF THE END OF THE MAIN (16"" STEEL MAIN) AND THAT THE PRESSURE WAS VERY LOW IN OUR INTERMEDIATE PRESSURE SYSTEM (7.5 PSIG) ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CITY. BECAUSE IT APPEARED THAT WE HAD LOST ALL THE PRESSURE IN THIS SYSTEM, WE IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO SHUT-OFF ALL SERVICES ON THIS SYSTEM PRIOR TO REINSTATING GAS PRESSURE. BY APPROX 11:00 A.M. WE HAD PROCEEDED TO PHYSICALLY ISOLATE 1,896 CUSTS FROM THE SYSTEM. AT THIS POINT WE REACTIVATED GAS PRESSURE TOTHE AREA AND PROCEEDED TO TURN ON AND RELIGHT THE CUSTS WE HAD ISOLATED FROMTHE SYSTEM. WE COMPLETED THE MAJORITY OF THE RELIGHTS BY 2:00 A.M. ON FRIDAY, AUGUST 2, 1996. I HAVE ATTACHED A COPY OF THE INSPECTOR'S REPORT TO THIS REPORT. THE CITY FEELS THE MAIN FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO THIS SERVICE FAILURE WASTHE CONTRACTOR'S DECISION TO LEAVE THE EXISTING VALVE ON THE END OF THE DEAD-END LINE UNBLOCKED WHILE HE PERFORMED WORK DOWNSTREAM OF THIS VALVE."

THE SERVICEMEN ALONG WITH THE CLEAR LAKE AREA MANAGER ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AND IMMEDIATELY CONFERRED WITH THE CLEAR LAKE FIRE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS. THE EXPLOSION HAD OCCURED IN THE KITCHEN OF THE HOME. THE GAS TO THE HOME WAS SHUT OFF OUTSIDE AT THE METER SET. A MOTORIST WHO WAS TRAVELING ON S. 8TH ST. WHEN THE EXPLOSION HAPPENED, STOPPED AND SHUT OFF THE OUTSIDE GAS COCK. ONE INDIVIDUAL HAD BEEN IN THE HOME AT THE TIME OF THE EXPLOSION AND HE WAS BEING TREATED FOR BURNS BY FIRE AND RESCUE PERSONNEL. HE WAS LATER TAKEN TONORTH IOWA MERCY HOSPITAL IN MASON CITY AND THEN TRANSFERRED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF IOWA HOSPITAL IN IOWA CITY WITH BURNS ON HIS HANDS, FACE, AND BACK. THEAREA MANAGER DISPATCHED ONE OF THE SERVICEMAN TO WHERE THE CLEAR LAKE GAS CREW WAS WORKING. THE CREW WAS WORKING AWAY FROM THEIR TRUCK AND DID NOT HEAR THE INITIAL RADIO MESSAGE. THE SERVICEMAN ALSO NOTIFIED THE IPC GAS DEPARTMENTOFFICE IN MASON CITY, IA.. A LINE CREW WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE TO CUT THE ELECTRICITY AT THE POLE AND ELIMINATE THAT SOURCE OF IGNITION. ONE OF THE SERVICEMEN STARTED TO CHECK THE SERVICE LINE TO THE HOME. HE PROBED ALONG THE SERVICE AT 5' INTERVALS FROM THE HOUSE TO THE PARKING. HE ALSO PROBED ALONG THE NORTH SIDE OF THE HOME. NO GAS WAS FOUND. NEXT HE SOAPED AND CHECKED THE ENTIRE METER SET FOR LEAKS. NO LEAKS WERE FOUND. THE CLEAR LAKE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS IN CHARGE OF THE SCENE AND THEY HAD PLACED A GAS DRIVEN FAN IN THE YARDTO HELP VENTILATE THE HOME. THE SERVICEMAN CHECKED THE UPSTAIRS OF THE HOME AND FOUND 5% LEL. THE OTHER SERVICEMAN WAS CHECKING THE ADJOINING HOMES FOR GAS. HE COULD NOT GAIN ENTRY INTO 801 S. 8TH ST., SO HE CHECKED THE CRAWL SPACE OF THE HOME FOR GAS. NO GAS WAS FOUND. THE LINE CREW ARRIVED AND PROCEEDED TO CUT THE ELECTRICITY AT THE POLE. BONDED PLUMBING OF CLEAR LAKE WAS CONTACTED TO PERFORM AN INDEPENDENT TEST ON THE CUSTOMER'S PIPING. THE GAS CREW ARRIVED AND REMOVED THE GAS METER AND REGULATOR FOR FUTHER TESTS. THE CREW PLUGGED THE OUTLET OF THE GAS COCK AND LOCKED IT OFF. THE CREW THEN INSTALLED ANOTHER REGULATOR AND PLACED 7"" W.C. OF AIR PRESSURE ON THE INSIDE PIPING. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD PULLED OUT THE GAS STOVE AND EXPOSED THE FLEX CONNECTOR. THEFLEX CONNECTOR WAS SOAPED AND NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON THE CONNECTOR. BONDED PLUMBING ARRIVED AND STARTED TESTING THE INSIDE PIPING AT 30 PSIG. WHILE CHECKING FOR LEAKS IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE CUSTOMER HAD AN UNDERGROUND SERVICE TO HIS GARAGE. THE AIR TEST FAILED. THE PRESSURE DROPPED TO 18 PSIG DURING THE ONE HOUR TEST. THE PIPING WAS CAPPED AND THE GAS AND ELECTRICITY TO THE HOME WERE LEFT OFF. THE SERVICMEN BEGAN TAKING ODORANT READS THROUGHOUT THE AREA. THE CUSTOMER AT 811 S. 8TH ST. COMMENTED THAT SHE WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY SMELLING THE GAS BECAUSE SHE STILL SMELLED THE BURNT RAGS FROM THE NEXT DOOR. THE ODORANT WAS FOUND TO BE ADEQUATE.

(1) OUTSIDE CONTRACTOR WORKING FOR CITY OF SAN JACINTO INSTALLED 12"" PVC WATER MAIN IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PROPER DEPTH BENT 3/4"" STEEL GAS SERVICE UP AND OVER PVC WATER MAIN. THIS ACTION PLACED THE 3/4"" GAS SERVICE IN CONTACT WITH AN ABANDONED 8"" STEEL WATER MAIN. (2) ELECTRICAL ARCHING OCCURRED BETWEEN 3/4"" GASSERVICE AND ABANDONED 8"" WATER MAIN. ON 10/2/96, AT 5:00PM, THE SOUTHERN CA.GAS COMPANY (GAS COMPANY) RECEIVED A REPORT OF A FIRE AND EXPLOSION WITH 3 INJURIES AT THE ABOVE ADDRESS. THE REPORT WAS RECEIVED FROM THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY FIRE DEPT. WITHIN MINUTES A GAS COMPANY PERSON WAS IN ROUTE FROM OUR RAMONA BASE TO ASSIST IN THE INVESTIGATION. UPON ARRIVAL, THE EMPLOYEE FOUND A WALL OF A STRUCTURE BLOWN DOWN AND A FIRE AT THIS ADDRESS. A DISTRIBUTION CREW WAS CALLED TO THE SCENE TO PINPOINT THE LEAK FOR REPAIR. GAS WAS UNDER CONTROLWITHIN 6 1/2 HRS AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL. GAS COMPANY CREWS WERE PROHIBITED FROMDIRECT ACCESS TO THE INCIDENT AREA UNTIL A POLICE INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETED REGARDING A POSSIBLE BOMBING. THE GAS COMPANY INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT LEAKAGE TO A 3/4"" SERVICE LINE WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF ELECTRICAL ARCING FROM AN UNKNOWN ELECTRICAL SOURCE BETWEEN THE GAS SERVICE AND AN ABANDONED 8"" STEEL WATER MAIN. IN ADDITION THE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY OF THE SERVICE LINE WAS COMPROMISED BY STRESS INDUCED DURING THE INSTALLATION OF A 12"" WATER PIPELINEBY A THIRD PARTY CONTRACTOR (WORKING FOR THE CITY WATER AGENCY) IN 1991.  THE SERVICE AND MAIN HAVE BEEN SURVEYED EVERY YEAR SINCE THEIR INSTALLATION IN 1953. DURING THAT PERIOD ONLY ONE LEAK WAS DETECTED (IN 1970) AND THIS LEAK WAS OF A NON-CORROSIVE VARIETY. THE SERVICE AND MAIN WERE LAST SURVEYED ON FEBRUARY 27, 1996. NO LEAKS WERE DETECTED AT THAT TIME. SUBSEQUENT TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE ELECTRICAL ARCING PROBLEM, THE GAS COMPANY INITIATED A WID SPREAD SPECIAL SURVEY IN THE AFFECTED AREA. ONE ADDITIONAL LEAK WAS FOUND FROM AN IDENTICAL ARCING PROBLEM. THE MAIN AND SERVICES IN THE AFFECTED AREA HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FROM FUTURE ELECTRICAL CONTACT. THE INVESTIGATION IS STILL UNDER WAYAND IF ANY SIGNIFICANT FACTS DEVELOP WE WILL SUBMIT AN UPDATED REPORT. PLEASE CALL FIL BERNAL AT (213)244-3283 IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING THIS REPORT."

UPON BURSTING, THE SOIL AND PAVEMENT ABOVE THE PIPELINE WAS DISRUPTED FOR APPROX 260 FEET ALONG THE SURFACE. THE STRENGTH TEST WAS BEING CONDUCTED TO UPRATE THE PIPE FROM A 60 PSIG DELIVERY SYSTEM TO A 228 PSIG SYSTEM. THE TEST MEDIUM WAS NITROGEN SET AT 425 PSIG FOR A ONE HOUR TEST. THE PIPELINE FAILED AT 53 MINUTES AND 45 SECONDS INTO THE TEST. THERE WAS NO NATURAL GAS RELEASE AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT. ALTHOUGH SOME MEDIA GROUPS REPORTED MUTLIPLE INJURIES REQUIRING HOSPITALIZATION, THERE IS IN FACT, ONLY ONE CONFIRMED INJURY. ONE SOUTHERN CA GAS COMP (THE GAS COMPANY) EMPLOYEE WAS SLIGHTLY INJURED WITH MINOR SCRAPES, BRUISES, A PUNCTURED EARDRUM AND A SMALL CUT AT THE TEMPLE AREA OF HIS HEAD. THE EMPLOYEE WAS TREATED AT A LOCAL MEDICAL CENTER AND RELEASED THE SAME AFTERNOON. ADDITIONALLY, FOUR INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE IN NEARBY STRUCTRES, HAVE FILED CLAIMS WITH THE GAS COMPANY REGARDING ALLEGED DIZZINESS AND/OR DUST INHALATION. NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE HOSPITALIZED AND THE GAS COMP IS INVESTIGATING THE CLAIMS. AN INVESTIGATION, SPONSORED BY THE GAS COMP, WAS CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT WHO SPECIALIZES IN PIPELINE FRACTURE MECHANICS (SEE ATTACHED). IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PIPELINE EXPLOSION RESULTED FROM FAILURE TO FOLLOW COMPANY PROCEDURES REGARDING THE FOLLOWING: THE COMPLETE PURGING OF ALLNATURAL GAS FROM A PIPELINE PRIOR TO FILLING IT WITH AN AIR/NITROGEN TEST MEDIUM. WELDING ON THE PIPELINE DURING THE TESTING OPERATION WITH A COMBUSTIBLEMIXTURE PRESENT, THE COMPANY CREW DID NOT FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PROCEDURES RELATIVE TO STRENGTH TESTING.

OUR DISPATCHER SENT A GAS SERVICEMANWHO SQUEEZED THE SERVICE TO SHUT-OFF THE FLOW OF GAS AT THE MAIN.

IT WAS LATER DETERMINEDTHAT THE GAS WAS LEAKING FROM THE WEATHER SEAL IN THE BURIED PORTION OF THERISER APPROXIMATELY 5 FEET FROM THE HOUSE FOUNDATION.  THE FOLLOWING DAY,WASHINGTON WATER POWER PERSONNEL IN THE PRESENCE OF THE BONNERS FERRY FIRECHIEF, INITIATED A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THISINCIDENT.  THE SOURCE OF THE GAS LEAK WAS DETERMINED TO BE AN 1/8-INCHDIAMETER HOLE IN THE 1/2 INCH POLYETHYLENE PIPING WITHIN THE GAS RISERCASING,  APPROXIMATELY 6-INCHES BELOW THE METER VALVE AT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEENGROUND LEVEL.  THE AREA OF FAILURE APPEARS TO HAVE OCCURRED INSTANTANEOUSLYDUE TO AN ELECTRICAL FAULT (WE BELIEVE MOST LIKELY A LIGHTING STRIKE).  THEPIPE IS MELTED ONLY AT THIS LOCATION AND ONLY ON ONE SIDE OF THE PIPE.  THETRACER WIRE SHOWED EVIDENCE OF ELECTRICAL ARCING AT THIS LOCATION ALSO.  THEFIRE DID NOT CONSUME THE METER SO IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT SUFFICIENT HEAT WAS INTHIS AREA TO HAVE CAUSED THIS LEAK.

THE GAS SERVICEMAN ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AT 7:13 AM ANDDISCOVERED GAS LEAKING FROM THE REGULATOR VENTS AT THE WHEATFIELD-SOUTHSTATION.  THE WHEATFIELD-SOUTH REGULATOR STATION, BUILT IN 1966, IS ONE OF TWOREGULATOR STATIONS SUPPLYING THE TOWN OF WHEATFIELD.  THE OTHER STATION,WHEATFIELD-NORTH, WAS RECENTLY CONSTRUCTED AND ACTIVATED TO MAINTAINACCEPTABLE DISTRIBUTION PRESSURE TO THE TOWN.  BOTH STATIONS ARE A 4-REGULATORCONFIGURATION, CONTAINING OPERATOR AND MONITOR REGULATORS IN PARRALLEL RUNS.WHEATFIELD-NORTH ALSO CONTAINS A RELIEF VALVE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE.REGULATORS AT EACH STATION ARE SET TO PROVIDE 50 PSIG INTO THE WHEATFIELDDISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  THE SERVICEMAN RADIOED CENTRAL DISPATCH REQUESTING FIELDASSISTANCE FROM THE GAS SYSTEMS OPERATIONS DEPARTMENT (GSO), THE GROUP THATMAINTAINS THE REGULATOR STATIONS.  AFTER THIS REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE, ATAPPROXIMATELY 7:25AM, AN EXPLOSION OCCURRED AT THE HOME OF MS. SANDRA GOTT,489 GROVE STREET, IN WHEATFIELD.  FIVE OCCUPANTS IN THE HOME WERE TAKEN TO THEHOSPITAL FOR TREATMENT.  (THREE OCCUPANTS WERE RELEASED LATER THAT SAME DAY,ONE WAS RELEASED SEVERAL DAYS LATER, AND ONE REMAIN HOSPITALIZED.)  THE GASSERVICEMAN'S FIELD ASSESSMENT WAS RELAYED TO THE GAS OPERATING CENTER (GOC)WHICH INSTRUCTED HIM TO CLOSE THE VALVES AT THE WHEATFIELD-SOUTH REGULATORSTATION, TAKING IT OUT OF SERVICE.  THE SERVICEMAN CLOSED THE VALVES AT THEREGULATOR STATION BUT REPORTED THAT GAS WAS STILL LEAKING FROM THE REGULATORVENTS.  A TECHNICIAN FROM THE GSO DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AT WHEATFIELD-SOUTHSHORTLY AFTER 8AM AND OBSERVED THE PRESSURE CHART RECORDER WAS READING INEXCESS OF THE 150 PSIG RANGE OF THE INSTRUMENT.  THE TECHNICIAN THEN DROVE TOTHE WHEATFIELD-NORTH STATION TO ASSESS THE SITUATION AT THAT LOCATION.  UPONARRIVING AT THE WHEATFIELD-NORTH REGULATOR STATION THE TECHNICIAN NOTED THATTHE RELIEF VALVE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE OF THE STATION WAS VENTING GAS TOTHE ATMOSPHERE.  USING AND INDICATING PRESSURE GAUGE HE FOUND THE PRESSURE ONTHE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM AT THAT SITE IN EXCESS OF THE 300 PSIG RANGE OF THEGAUGE.  AT APPROXIMATELY 8:15AM THE TECHNICIAN CLOSED THE VALVES TO THEWHEATFIELD_NORTH REGULATOR STATION, TAKING IT OUT OF SERVICE.  FIELDMAINTENANCE PERSONNEL FROM THE GSO DEPARTMENT ARRIVED ON THE SCENE AND BEGANTO REMOVE A BLIND FLANG TO A BLOW-OFF VALVE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SIDE OF THEWHEATFIELD-SOUTH STATION.  BY 8:45AM THE BLOW-OFF VALVE WAS OPENED ANDRELEASING GAS FROM THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM.  BY 9:15AM DISTRIBUTION PRESSUREWAS FULLY RELIEVED.  NIPSCO PERSONNEL BEGAN DEVELOPING AN INCIDENT ASSESSMENTAND RESTORATION STRATEGY. OVER THE FOLLOWING HOURS MEMBER OS THE GSODEPARTMENT INVESTIGATED THE CAUSE OF THE OVERPRESSURE SITUATION.  FOLLOWINGREACTIVATION OF THE WHEATFIELD-SOUTH STATION A LEAK SURVEY OF THE ENTIRESYSTEM WAS PERFORMED.  LOCAL DISTRIBUTION CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCEPERSONNEL STARTED CUSTOMER RELIGHTS AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 PM TUESDAY, WHICHWERE COMPLETED BY 5PM WEDNESDAY.  ALL SERVICE REGULATORS ON METER SETS WEREREPLACED BEFORE RESTORING SERVICE TO INDIVIDUAL HOMES.

THIS RESULTED IN 419 PSIG OFGAS PRESSURE ENTERING THE CUSTOMER'S EXTENSIVE PLANT PIPING SYSTEM RATED AT 60PSIG MAOP.  OUR TECHNICIANS RESPONDED TO THE REMOTE LOCATION, ISOLATED THEPLANT PIPING, AND PERFORMED MAINTENANCE ON THE MONITOR SETTING TO GET IT INPROPER WORKING CONDITION.  DURING THIS PERIOD, PLANT PERSONNEL WERE REPLACINGSOME OF THEIR INTERNAL REGULATORS AND ISOLATING VARIOUS PIPING SYSTEMS FROMTHE MAIN PLANT PIPING IN ORDER TO GET THE PLANT BACK IN OPERATION.  THE PLANTPERSONNEL ASSURED US THAT REPAIRS WERE MADE AND PIPING WAS IN PROPER ORDERAND HAD OUR TECHNICIANS INITIATE SERVICE TO THE PLANT AFTER A 40 PSIG LEAKCHECK WAS PERFORMED.

THE SERVICEMAN WAS SEARCHING FOR THE LEAK OUTSIDE THE BUILDING WHEN A FIRE STARTED INSIDE THE HOUSE.  THE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AND RESPONDED IMMEDIATELY AND THE FIRE WAS PUT OUT.  THE HOUSE WAS COMPLETELY GUTTED.  THE SERVICEMAN ON THE SCENE EVACUATED THE HOMEOWER AND SHUT OFF THE GAS AT THE OUTSIDE METER AT THE TIME THE FIRE WAS DETECTED.

THE THIRD AUGER HOLE WAS UNCOVERED AND FOUND THAT THE AUGER HAD STRUCK THE 8"" MAIN ""DEAD CENTER"" REMOVING APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE PIPE WALL THICKNESS.  THE DRILLER INDICATED HE HAD CEASED DRILLING IN THIS HOLE BECAUSE HE RAN INTO SOMETHING HARD AND WHEN HE PULLED UP HIS BIT HE HAD METAL SHAVINGS ON IT.  TO MAKE PERMANENT REPAIRS, A PRESSURE CONTOL FITTING WAS WELDED ON THE 8"" MAIN AND NEARBY VALVE WAS CLOSEDD TO ISOLATE THE DAMAGED SECTION OF MAIN.  A 12 SECTION OF PIPE CONTAINING ALL THREE DAMAGES WAS REMOVED AND A PIECE OF PRETESTED PIPE WAS WELDED IN ITS PLACE.  THE CONTRACTOR HAD REQUESTED LOCATES AND ENSTAR HAD LOCATED THE PIPE PRIOR TO DRILLING.  ENSTARS LOCATE MARKS WERE SEVERAL INCHES OUTSIDE THE 2 ACCURACY LIMITS PLACED ON IT BY LOCAL ORDIANCE.  HOWEVER, LOCAL ORDINANCE REQUIRES ALL LOCATED UTILITIES TO BE EXPOSED PRIOR TO EXCAVATING AND TO REPORT ANY DAMAGE IMMEDIATELY UPON KNOWLEDGE OF SUCH DAMAGE.  ENSTAR BELIEVES IT WAS UNREASONABLE FOR THE HOLES TO BE DRILLED WITHIN 5 OF ITS LINE WITHOUT PHYSICALLY EXPOSING THE PIPE.  ENSTAR ALSO BELIEVES IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED WHEN METAL SHAVINGS WERE FOUND ON THE DRILL BIT.  ENSTAR IS ACTIVELY PURSUING COLLECTION OF THIS CLAIM."

CURL STATED THAT HE TURNED THE GAS VALVE OFF TO THE HEATING STOVE BEFORE VACATING THE HOUSE. MR. LOUIS CURL RECEIVED NO INJURIES FROM THE FIRE. THE LG&E GAS ERVICE TO 903 ELM ST WAS A ONE INCH SERVICE CONSISITNG OF 1 INCH BARE STEEL PIPE APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET IN LENGTH FROM THE 10 INCH LG&E DISTRIBUTION MAIN TO THE GAS SERVICE STOP BOX. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE PIPING WAS 1 INCH BARE STEEL  PIPE APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET IN LENGTH. THE SERVICE WAS INSTALLED IN 1942. THE COPMANY SERVICE PIPING WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPLACED WITH 3/4 INCH STEEL PIPE WITH A THIN MILL  COATING FROM A NEW 2 INCH LG&E DISTRIBUTION MAIN OPERATING AT 15 PSIG ON JULY 22, 1974. THE MOST RECENT LEAK SURVEY ON THE GAS SERVICE AT 903 ELM ELM ST WAS CONDUCTED  DURING JUNE OF 1999. NO LEAKS WERE FOUND ON EITHER THE COMPANY OWNED OR CUSTOMER OWNED PIPING. THE MOST RECENT STOPBOX INSPECTION WAS CONDUCTED ON OCT19,1995. THE MOST RECENT SERVICE CALL TO 903 ELM ST WAS MADE ON FEB. 25, 1985 WHEN THE GAS  METER WAS CHANGED. THERE WERENO CALLS  TO LG&E PRIOR TO THE INCIDENT ABOUT ANY NATURAL GAS LEAKS OR ODORS FROM THE MR.CURL OR ANY OF THE NEIGHBORS.

GAS ODORANT LEVELS WERE CHECKED ON FEB. 17,2000 AT 602 ELM ST AND ON THE DAY OF THE INCIDENT AT MULBERRY ST WHICH IS LOCATED BEHIND 903 ELM ST. THE ODORANT LEVELS WERE SATISFACTORY. THE EXPLOSION WASINVESTIGATED BY DEPUTY SHERIFF OFFICE AND MR KEITH MCBRIDE FIRE AND SECURITY INVESTIGATOR LOUISVILLE GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY.THE INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT CONCLUDED THAT GAS HAD BUILT UPUNDER THE FLOOR  IN THE CRAWL SPACE. ONCE THERE WAS ENOUGH GAS TO REACH AN IGNITION SOURCE MOST PROBABLY THE HEATING STOVE THE GAS IGNITED. THE BIULK OF THE GAS WAS IN THE CRAWL SPACE THUS THE BLOWING OF THE BRICK OUT ON ALL FOUR SIDES. THE HOUSE PIPING WAS IN THE SAME AREA AS THE POINT OF THE ORIGINOF THE FIRES WHICH WAS ALONG THE SOUTH WALL. THE GAS MOST LIKELY RESULTED FROM LEAKS IN THE HOUSE PIPING AND CAME FROM UNDER THE FLOOR AND WENT UP IN TO THE REAR WALL SPACE AND CAME OUT AT THE LOCATION WHERE THE STOVE WAS LOCATED.

OUR PIPELINES WERE TWELVE FEET DEEP AT THE POINT OF IMPACT.  OUR INITIAL RESPONDERS THOUGHT THE 8 INCH STEEL LINE WAS HIT AND BLOWING BASED ON OBSERVATION AT THE JOB SITE.  ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO LOWER THE PRESSURE ON THE PIPELINE.  THE CONTRACTOR WAS RELOCATING HIS TRACK HOE AND WHEN HE WENT TO PARK IT HE SWUNG HIS BOOM AROUND KNOCKING A POWER CABLE OFF AND ADJACENT POWER POLE CAUSING A SPARK THAT IGNITED THE GAS.  THE FIRE EVENTUALLY BURNED THE CAB OF A TRACK HOE AND THE FIBER OPTIC CABLE THAT RILEY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY HAD BEEN HIRED TO LOWER.  WE LOWERED THE PRESSURE ON THE 8 INCH MAIN TO ENABLE US TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE AND MAKE REPAIRS.  THE LOWERING THE PRESSURE WE REALIZED THE FIRE WAS NOT GETTING SMALLER AND TOOK CORRECTIVE ACTION ON THE 4 INCH PLASTIC LINE TO HELP LOWER THE PRESSURE TO EXTINGUISH THE FIRE.  WE BUILT A BY PASS AROUND THE DAMAGED AREA TO KEEP GAS IN OUR SYSTEM AND ISOLATED THE DAMAGED LINE FOR THE EVENING.

TWO CONTRACT WORKERS HAD COMPLETED THE JOINING OF A 2"" SECTION OF POLYETHYLENE PIPE (PE 2406, UPONOR) WITH A 2"" COATED STEEL MAIN USING A 2"" STYLE 90 DRESSER COUPLING AND FITTINGS.  THE POLYETHYLENE PIPE HAD BEEN INSERTED WITH AN INTERNAL STEEL STIFFENER.  THE JOINT HAD BEEN PRESSURE TESTED AND CONTRACT EMPLOYEES, MR. BOBBY ENGLEDOW OF TEX-CON AND MR. MARIO ESTRADA OF ELLIOTT CONSTRUCTION, WERE RE-COATING THE REPRESSURIZED STEEL PIPE WHEN THE STEEL LINE SEPARATED FROM THE COUPLING.  UPON RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS, BOTH INDIVDUALS ESCAPED THE AREA WITHOUT INJURY.  MR. GREER WAS STANDING OVER THE EXCAVATION AND RECEIVED BURNS TO THE FACE AND HANDS UPON IGNITION OF NATURAL GAS.  FIELD PERSONNEL EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE AFTER APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE BY CLOSING APPROPRIATE VALVES AT THE SITE.  MR. GREER WAS TRANSPORTED TO GRIMES COUNTY ST JOSEPHS HOSPITAL WHERE HE WAS ADMITTED AND TREATED FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND SUBSEQUENTLY RELEASED FOR OUT-PATIENT CARE.  THE SCENE WAS MADE SAFE AND SECURED PENDING THE ARRIVAL OF THE TEXAS RAILROAD COMMISSION.  THE AGENCIES WERE NOTIFIED AND A PROBABLE CAUSE INVESTIGATION WAS CONDUCTED.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS INADEQUATE ANCHORING OF THE STEEL PIPE BY THE DRESSER COUPLING UNDER THE CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT.  THE SEPARATION OF THE STEEL PIPE FROM THE COUPLING RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS."

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE RESPONSE TO THIS INCIDENT:12:46 SYSTEM OPERATIONAL DISPATCH DISPATCHES SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE MARTIN TO THE SCENE. UPON HIS ARRIVAL, SERVICE REP MARTIN FINDS THAT THE SYRACUSE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAS SHUT OFF THE GAS AT THE SHUT OFF IN THE HOUSE. 12:50 GAS DISPATCH IS ALERTED. MARK RYBINSKI, MANAGER OF GAS AND ELECTRIC CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE IS INFORMED OF THE INCIDENT AND ACTIVATES THE DIVISIONAL GAS EMERGENCY ORGANIZATION AT THE DISPATCH OFFICE ON E-1,300 ERIE BLVD. SYRACUSE. ANETTE BRATEK, GAS SUPERVISOR IS ALERTED OF THE INCIDENT. 12:59 CHIEF GAS MECHANIC, ROBERT POWERS IS DISPATCHED TO MOVE HIS CREW TO THE SCENE.13:05 GAS CREW ARRIVES AT THE SCENE AND BEGINS AN OUTSIDE, UNDERGROUND INVESTIGATION. THIS INVESTIGATION INCLUDES TAKING BAR HOLE READINGS WITH A COMBUSTIBLE GAS INDICATOR AT THE APPROPRIATE LOCATIONS ALONG THE GAS SERVICE AND GAS MAIN LINES. ALL BAR HOLE READINGS SHOW NO GAS PRESENT IN THE GROUND. AFTER CONDUCTING THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION, THE GAS CREW EXCAVATES THE SERVICE AND PERFORMS A PRESSURE CHECK BETWEEN THE MAIN AND THE INSIDE SHUT OFF AT 90PSI FOR 15 MINUTES. THIS TEST SHOWED NO LOSS OF PRESSURE IN THE FACILITY. DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD, THE GAS DEPARTMENT CONDUCTED A MOBILE LEAK INVESTIGATION WITH A FLAME IONIZATION UNIT AND PERFORMED ODORIZATION CHECKS. THE F.I. SURVEY SHOWED NO INDICATION OF A LEAK IN THE STREET AND THE ODORZATION TESTS INDICATED THE APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF ODORANT IN THE GAS. 13:35 SERVICE DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR PAUL HART ARRIVES AND DIRECTS SERVICE PERSONNEL IN PERFORMING WALL CHECKS AT NUMBERS 214,218,220,221,223,224,229,230 AND 231 PRIMROSE AVE. ALL  CHECKS SHOW NO GAS IN THE ATMOSPHERE IN THESE RESIDENCES. AT THE SAME TIME, SERVICE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL, WITH INVESTIGATORS FROM SYRACUSE FIRE DEPARTMENT, CONDUCTED AN INSIDE INVESTIGATION OF THE CUSTOMERS GAS LINES. THE GAS WAS TURNED ON AND A PRESSURE CHECK WAS DONE AT THE METER. A TEN-MINUTE TEST AT 8.9 IN. W.C. SHOWED NO MOVEMENT OF THE HALF FOOT DIAL ON THE METER. AN ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL CHECK OF THE APPLIANCES WAS DONE. ALL WERE FOUND TO BE IN GOOD WORKING ORDER AND WERE VENTED PROPERLY. A 3/4 INCH LINE THAT TERMINATED WITH AN UNPLUGGED VALVE IN THE CLOSED POSITION WAS FOUND IN THE VICINITY OF THE ELECTRIC DRYER. THIS WAS ALSO THE APPARENT AREA OF ORIGIN OF THE FIRE/EXPLOSION. IT COULD BE DETERMINED IF EITHER NIMO OR FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL HAD CLOSED THIS VALVE. AFTER ALL TESTING WAS COMPLETED, THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE TO THIS ADDRESS WAS RENEWED USING 1"" PLASTIC PIPE. THE SERVICE WAS LEFT LOCKED IN THE OFF POSITION. ALL TESTING WAS CONDUCTED IN THE PRESENCE OF KEVIN SPEICHER OF THE NEW YORK STATE PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WHO DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT WAS NOT A RESULT OF ANY FAILURE ON THE PART OF NIAGARA MOHAWK OR OF NIAGARA MOHAWKS GAS DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO THE REQUIRED LOCAL AND STATE AGENCY NOTIFICATIONS, A PRECAUTIONARY NOTIFICATION TO THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION WAS MADE IT BECAME APPARENT THAT A RESIDENT OF THE HOUSE WAS TRANSPORTED TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL."

DAMAGE WAS SUSTAINED TO HOUSES IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO 461 GROVE AVE. TOTAL DAMAGE WAS ESTIMATED IN THE RANGE OF $200,000 TO $300,00. NORTHERN INDIANA PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANYS PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REVEALED TWO POSSIBLE SOURCES OF NATURAL GAS ACCUMULATION IN THE HOME:1)A COMPANY MAINTENANCE CREW INADVERTENTLY DAMAGED THE UNDERGROUND SERVICE LINE WHEN THEY STOPPED THE FLOW OF NATURAL GAS TO BEGIN REPAIRS TO THE SERVICE LINE AT 461 GROVE AVENUE EARLIER THAT AFTERNOON. THE PLASTIC SERVICE LINE WAS DAMAGED WHEN THE CREW OPERATED A STEEL VALVE WHICH CONTAINED 5/8"" INSERTED PLASTIC LINE. THE CREW WAS UNAWARE OF THE DAMAGE, WHICH RESULTED IN THE MIGRATION OF NATURAL GAS THROUGH THE SOIL NEAR THE CUSTOMERS HOME. 2)LATER THAT SAME AFTERNOON, THE CUSTOMER TOOK FURTHER ACTION TO CHANGE HIS NATURAL GAS PIPE SYSTEM AT A POINT DOWNSTREAM FROM THE METER AND THROUGH THE FOUNDATION OF THE HOUSE. A PIPE UNION INVOLVED IN THE WORK PERFORMED BY THE CUSTOMER WAS FOUND TO BE APPROXIMATELY 1-1/2 TURNS LOOSE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH EITHER OF THESE TWO POTENTIAL SOURCES CONTRIBUTED TO THE ACCUMULATION OF NATURAL GAS WITHIN THE HOME HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED. FURTHER, THE EXACT SOURCE OF IGNITION IS STILL UNKNOWN."

THE MAIN WAS OPERATING AT 149.25 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE DIG-IN. WITHIN ONE MINUTE OF THE HIT LINE, THE OPERATOR OF THE 1994 KOMATSU,MODEL NUMBER PC400LC, HAD REMOVED HIMSELF FROM THE OPERATORS CAB OF THE TRAC-HOE AND BEGAN TO BLOCK TRAFFIC. A CITY OF MESA POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS DRIVING BY EXCAVATION SITE AT THE TIME OF THE DIG-IN, HAD STOPPED TO AID THE OPERATOR WHEN THE VENTING NATURAL GAS IGNITED. THE RESULTING FIRE FROM THE NATURAL GAS LINE IGNITING, CAUSED EXTENSIVE DAMAGE TO THE TRACHOE, SEVERAL OVERHEAD UTILITY LINES (ELECTRIC, CABLE TV, TELEPHONE), ONE POWER POLE, AN ADVERTISING SIGN TO A LOCAL BUSINESS OFFICE COMPLEX, AND ONE LARGE PALM TREE. THERE WERE NO INJURIES, MEDICAL EMERGENCIES, OR DEATHS AS A RESULT OF THE DIG-IN. TWO GAS VALVES WERE CLOSED AND THE DIG-IN IS ESTIMATED TO BE $13,563.08 OR 2,811 DKTH, BASED ON THE COST OF GAS AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. DAMAGE ASSESSMENTS ESTIMATED TO PROPERTY LOSSES HAVE YET TO BE DETERMINED, HOWEVER IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME THE LOSS WILL EXCEED THE REPORTING LIMITS REQUIRED BY FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS. THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT POINTS TO TWO FACTORS. FIRST THE CITY OF MESAS UTILITY LOCATE OR ""BLUE STAKE MARK"" WAS FOUND TO BE FIVE (5) FEET EAST OF THE ACTUAL LOCATION OF THE FOUR (4"") HP NATURAL GAS MAIN. THE SECOND WAS THE CONTRACTOR, ARCHON,INC. FAILED TO ""POTHOLE"" AND LOCATE THE HP GAS NATURAL GAS MAIN PRIOR TO THE BEGINNING OF EXCAVATION ACTIVITY FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A SEWER MANHOLE. THE MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT ARE THE ADEQUACY OF THE UTILITY LOCATE MARKS BY THE CITY OF MESA AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXCAVATION ACTIVITY FOR THE INSTALLATION OF A SEWER MANHOLE. THE MAJOR SAFETY ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THIS REPORT ARE THE ADEQUACY OF THE UTILITY LOCATE MARKS BY THE CITY OF MESA AND THE REQUIREMENTS OF AN EXCAVATOR TO: ""NOTIFY EITHER THE OWNER OF AN UNDERGROUND FACILITY OR AN ORGANIZATION DESIGNATED BY THE OWNER IF THE EXCAVATOR ENCOUNTERS AN UNDERGROUD FACILITY THAT HAS NOT BEEN MARKED OR HAS BEEN MARKED IN THE WRONG LOCATION""(ARIZONA REVISED STATUE, (ARS)40-360-23).

THIS EVENT WAS REPORTED AS A FIRE AND EXPLOSION WHICH RESULTED IN PROPERTY DAMAGE OF MORE THAN $50,000.00. AT THE TIME OF THIS REPORT, IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT NATURAL GAS WAS INVOLVED. MORE CAREFUL INVESTIGATION DONE SINCE THE EVENT INDICATES THAT THE EVENT WAS NOT CAUSED BY A RELEASE OF NATURAL GAS.

NASMAN	4134450303	"THE FOLLOWING PRESENTS INFORMATION RELATED TO THE RECENT INCIDENT EXPERIENCE BY THE BERKSHIRE GAS COMPANY (""BERKSHIRE"") WITH REGARDS TO THE OVER-PRESSURIZATION OF ITS PITTSFIELD LOW PRESSURE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ON SUNDAY, JUNE 3, 2001. BASED ON BERKSHIRES ANALYSIS, THE OVERPRESSURE OF THE PITTSFIELD LOW-PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS CAUSED BY FLOODING OF THE EAST STREET REGULATOR PIT CREATED WHEN A GENERAL CONTRACTORS SITE DRAINAGE CONTROL MEASURES IN THE AREA OF THE REGULATOR PIT PREVENTED PROPER DRAINAGE AND SUBSEQUENT LOW-PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE COMPANY, IN-CONJUNCTION WITH THE STREET RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT, IS PRESENTLY INSTALLING NEW REGULATOR PITS TO REPLACE THIS PIT. THE EAST STREET LOW-PRESSURE REGULATOR STATION CONSISTS OF TWO (2) FISHER 298 TEK REGULATORS CONFIGURED IN A WORKING MONITOR CONFIGURATION. THE PIT WAS ORIGINALLY EQUIPPED WITH TWO 8"" VENT STACKS FOR VAULT VENTILATION. THREE (3) FISHER 61H PILOTS ARE USED IN THIS CONFIGURATION WITH THE OVERRIDE PILOT VENT LINE VENTED IN ONE OF THE 8"" VENT STACKS. THE VENT LINES FOR THE PILOTS WERE RUN TO THE TOP OF THE REGULATOR VAULT AND ""CANDY CANED"" OVER. THE FIRST STAGE REGULATION REDUCES PRESSURES FROM 100 PSIG TO 10 PSIG. THE SECOND STAGE REGULATION REDUCES THE 10 PSIG TO 12"" WC (WATER COLUMN). DUE TO MAJOR ROAD RECONSTRUCTION IN THE AREA OF THE REGULATOR PIT AND THE RELOCATION OF THE ROADWAY, THE REMOVAL OF THE EXISTING VENT STACK WAS NECESSARY TO ACCOMMODATE THIS CONSTRUCTION. BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE OF WATER/DRAINAGE CONDITIONS IN THE AREA, THE COMPANY RE-VENTED THE EXISTING OVERRIDE PILOT INSIDE OF THE REGULATOR PIT BASED ON PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PIT HAS NOT HAD WATER PROBLEMS AND THAT THIS VENTING MODIFICATION WAS ONLY A TEMPORARY CONDITION UNTIL THE NEW PIT WAS ACTIVATED. ON SUNDAY JUNE 3, THE PITTSFIELD AREA EXPERIENCED A RAINFALL EVENT IN WHICH RAINFALL IN THE AREA OF THE REGULATOR PIT WAS NOT ABLE TO DRAIN PROPERLY INTO THE CATCH BASINS DUE TO THE RESTRICTION CAUSED BY HAY BAILS SURROUNDING THE CATCH BASIN.THIS SITUATION CAUSED FLOODING IN THE AREA OF THIS REGULATOR PIT. THE FLOODING WAS SUCH THAT WATER ENTERED THE REGULATOR PIT AND ENTERED THE RELOCATED OVERRIDE PILOT VENT LINES AND CAUSED THE REGULATORS TO FAIL. THE ROAD CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTOR COINCIDENTALLY WAS ON-SITE TO RECTIFY THE DRAINAGE PROBLEM AND HAD BEEN CONTACTED BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES BECAUSE OF THE FLOODING THEY WERE CAUSING. THE CONTRACTOR REMOVED THE HAY BAILS AND THE DRAINAGE SYSTEM IMMEDIATELY REMOVED THE FLOODING CONDITION, WHICH ALLOWED BERKSHIRE GAS OPERATIONS STAFF TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE REGULATOR PIT AND REMOVE WATER IN THE PIT. WHEN THE WATER ENTERED THE VAULT. THE WATER PRESSURE FILLED THE PILOT VENT PIPING, AND CHANGED THE SETTINGS OF THE PILOT DUE TO THE WATER PRESSURE. WHEN THE VAULT WAS PUMPED THE SPRING PRESSURE OF THE PILOT PUSHED THE WATER OUT OF THE VENT LINES AND THE PIT RETURNED TO NORMAL OPERATION. AT NO TIME DID ANY WATER ACTUALLY GET INTO THE PILOTS OR REGULATORS. THE REGULATOR PIT WAS THEN RETURNED TO SERVICE AND IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT SYSTEM PRESSURES BACK TO NORMAL OPERATING PRESSURES. BASED ON THE TIMING OF EVENTS IT BELIEVED THE OVERPRESSURIZATION OCCURRED FOR APPROXIMATELY 1.5 HOURS.

AN ENSTAR SERVICE TECHNICIAN WAS DISPATCHED TO THE SCENE. THE ANCHORAGE FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS ALSO NOTIFIED. THE ON-CALL SUPERVISOR AND DISTRIBUTION PERSONNEL WERE CALLED IN TO RESPOND. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE LOCATION OF THE GAS LEAK, THE SERVICE TECHNICIAN REPORTED FINDING A 6"" STEEL MAIN PULLED OUT OF A DRESSER COUPLING AND GAS BLOWING AT 60 PSIG FROM BOTH ENDS OF THE MAINS. ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES WERE CALLED IN INCLUDING THE VP OF OPERATIONS VP OF ENGINEERING AND THE DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISOR ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION AND SERVICE EMPLOYEES. AT APPROXIMATELY 9:30 PM ENSTARS VP OF OPERATIONS ARRIVED AT THE LOCATION OF THE LEAK AND SET UP A COMMAND SITE WITH ENSTARS ON-CALL SUPERVISOR AND THE ANCHORAGE FIRE DEPARTMENT (AFD). AFD WAS IN THE PROCESS OF EVACUATING HOMES WITHIN A ONE-BLOCK RADIUS OF THE BLOWING GAS. TWO VALVES ON THE 6"" MAIN NEEDED TO BE CLOSED AND A 4"" HDPE MAIN NEEDED TO BE SQUEEZED OFF TO ISOLATE THE BLOWING GAS. AT 9:45 PM, AN ENSTAR CREW CLOSED ONE 6"" VALVE TO ISOLATE THE BLOWING GAS FROM THE WEST SIDE OF THE BREAK. THE CREW THEN WENT TO THE 6"" VALVE SEVERAL BLOCKS TO THE EAST. THEY OBTAINED UTILITY LOCATES ON THE BURIED VALVE. THE VALVE WAS EXCAVATED AND SHUT DOWN AT 11:08 PM. SIMULTANEOUSLY A SECOND CREW WORKED ON GETTING UTILITY LOCATES AND EXPOSING THE 4"" HDPE MAIN. THE 4"" MAIN WAS PINCHED OFF AT 11:26 PM TO STOP ALL BLOWING GAS. APPROXIMATELY 175 CUSTOMERS WERE LEFT WITHOUT NATURAL GAS SERVICE UNTIL REPAIRS WERE MADE. CREWS WORKED THROUGH THE NIGHT TO REPAIR THE 6"" MAIN. THE MAIN WAS PUT BACK IN SERVICE AT APPROXIMATELY 7:00 AM, TUESDAY, AUGUST 21, 2001. GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED CUSTOMERS WAS TURNED ON THROUGHOUT THAT DAY. UPON INVESTIGATION, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT A CONTRACTOR, WHILE INSTALLING A CONCRETE ELECTRICAL DUCT BANK SYSTEM, HAD PARTIALLY AND/OR ENTIRELY EXPOSED ENSTARS 6"" STEEL MAIN FOR APPROXIMATELY 150. THE 6"" GAS MAIN WAS LEFT EXPOSED AND UNSUPPORTED IN THE SIDE BANK OF THE OPEN DITCH EXCAVATION. ENSTAR SUSPECTS VIBRATIONS FROM CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT AND COMPACTION EQUIPMENT CAUSED THE SIDES OF THE OPEN EXCAVATION TO SLOUGH AND MOVE THE GAS MAIN, CAUSING THE 6"" GAS MAIN TO PULL OUT OF A 6"" DRESSER COMPRESSION COUPLING LOCATED AT A 90 DEGREE ELL. ENSTAR HAD RECEIVED NO PRIOR NOTIFICATION FROM THE CONTRACTOR THAT THE MAIN WOULD BE EXPOSED OR A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN SUPPORTING THE 6"" MAIN. THE CONTRACTOR DID NOT SUPPORT OR RESTRAIN THE 6"" GAS MAIN. ENSTAR IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE CONTRACTOR FOR ALL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPAIRS."

AROUND 2:53 PM WITH THE WATER STILL BEING RELEASED FROM THE WATER MAIN BREAK THE GROUND HAD BECOME SO UNDERMINED THAT OUR PIPELINE NO LONGER HAD UNDERGROUND SUPPORT AND IT COLLAPSED AND SEPARATED AT A DRESSER COUPLING WHICH JOINED THE PIPELINE TOGETHER AND GAS BEGAN TO FILL THE INTERSECTION AND SURROUNDING AREA.

AT 3:20 PM DOMINION EAST OHIO PERSONNEL WERE ON SITE AND RECOGNIZED GAS WAS BLOWING FROM AN APPARENT CONTRACTOR DIG IN. THEY ASSESSED THE SITUATION AND MADE THE IMMEDIATE DECISION TO CLOSE THREE GATE VALVES THAT WOULD ISOLATE THE PIPELINE. AT 3:32 PM THE DOMINION EAST OHIO SUPERVISOR ON SITE CALLED GAS CONTROL TO INFORM THEM THAT THE GAS HAD CAUGHT FIRE AND PROPERTY AND AUTOMOBILES WERE BEING DAMAGED BUT NO INJURIES TO ANY HUMANS HAD OCCURRED. LOCAL FIRE, RESCUE AND POLICE DEPARTMENTS HAD ALL ARRIVED AT THE SITE AND WERE WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALL INVOLVED TO HELP PUT OUT THE FIRE AND PROTECT THE PEOPLE IN THE AREA. THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED AROUND 3:50 PM WITH SIGNIFICANT FIRE DAMAGED TO LOCAL ESTABLISHMENTS, INFRASTRUCTURE AND AUTOMOBILES IN THE VICINTY. THE DAMAGED PORTION OF THE 20"" PIPELINE WAS REPLACED WITH NEW 20"" PIPE WHICH WAS JOINED BY WELDED JOINTS AND RECONNECTED AT THE ENDS BY DRESSER COUPLINGS AND REINFORCED WITH LUGS TO ADD EXTRA SUPPORT TO THE PIPELINE.

BECAUSE OF A CONFIRMED FATILITY.  BETWEEN 5:55 PM AND 6:15 PM., SCG PERSONNEL ISOLATED AND TESTED SCGS UNDERGROUND PIPING IN THE COMPLEX AREA.  THE UNDERGROUND PIPING HELD PRESSURE AND WAS LEAK FREE AT 60 PSIG, WHICH IS THE MAOP FOR THE SYSTEM.  THIS TESTING WAS OBSERVED AND SUPERVISED BY GPSU AND THE CONNECTICUT FIRE MARSHAL.  BAR HOLE TESTING WAS COMMENCED AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 A.M. AND WAS DONE IN SEVERAL AREAS OF THE CONDOMINUM COMPLEX DURING THE DAY.  THE BAR HOLE TESTING SHOWED THAT NATURAL GAS HAD NOT BEEN RELEASED INTO THE SOIL FROM SCG UNDERGROUND SYSTEM. SCG HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WERE NOT A RESULT OF ANY LEAKAGE ON ITS SYSTEM.  AT THIS POINT, SCG DOES NOT KNOW WHAT FUEL WAS IGNITED FIRST, WHERE THE ORIGIN OF THE FIRE WAS, OR WHAT THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT WAS.  THE EXPLOSION DAMAGED THE METERS AND REGULATORS THAT SERVED UNITS 6, 7 AND 8.  SCG IS CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE AND IS WORKING WITH THE FIRE MARSHAL AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES."

WHEN IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE TAPPER IN THE TEE WAS NOT FUNCTIONAL AND AFTER ATTEMPTING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO CONTROL THE LEAKS BY ARC WELDING THE TEE, THE CREW DECIDED TO REDIRECT THE FLOW OF GAS TO THE SIDE OF THE TEE AWAY FROM THE WORK AREA. THE LEAK WAS INTENTIONALLY IGNITED TO ELIMINATE NATURAL GAS ACCUMULATION IN THE BELLHOLE. THE CREW THEN PROCEEDED TO WELD ON A STOPPLE FITTING TO ISOLATE THE LEAKING TEE. AS THIS WAS A SINGLE FEED LINE WITH ONLY 3 CUSTOMERS PAST THE LEAK SITE, A DECISION WAS MADE TO USE A SINGLE STOPPLE FITTING AND RELIGHT THE CUSTOMERS. AFTER THE FITTING WAS WELDED, IT WAS TESTED AND TAPPED. PRIOR TO TAPPING IT WAS NOTICED THAT A BY-PASS, OR BLEEDER VALVE, WAS NOT IN PLACE ON THE TAPPING MACHINE. A VALVE WAS REMOVED FROM A SWEEP MACHINE AND PLACED ON THE TAPPING MACHINE. THE TAP WAS MADE, THE TAPPING MACHINE REMOVED, AND THE SWEEP MACHINE WAS INSTALLED TO REMOVE ANY STEEL SHAVINGS PRIOR TO INSTALLING THE STOPPER. AT THIS POINT, THE CREW FAILED TO REPLACE THE BLEEDER VALVE THAT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM THE SWEEP MACHINE. AS AN AVISTA EMPLOYEE OPENED THE SANDWICH VALVE TO INSERT THE SWEEP TOOL, A RELEASE OF GAS AT APPROXIMATELY 55 PSIG OCCURRED THROUGH A 1/4"" HOLE WHERE THE BLEEDER VALVE SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THE GAS WAS IGNITED FROM THE STANDING FLAME ON THE LEAKING SERVICE TEE AND ROLLED THROUGH THE DITCH. THE AVISTA EMPLOYEE WAS ABLE TO REACT AND TURN AWAY FROM THE FLAME, BUT HIS ARM WAS BURNED FROM ABOVE HIS GLOVE AT THE RIGHT WRIST TO ABOVE HIS RIGHT ELBOW. THE EMPLOYEE WAS PULLED FROM THE DITCH, THE FIRE EXTINGUISHED AND THE SANDWICH VALVE WAS CLOSED TO PREVENT ANY FURTHER RELEASE OF GAS. THE EMPLOYEE WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR 3 DAYS AT THE EMANUEL BURN CENTER IN PORTLAND, OREGON. HE IS EXPECTED TO MAKE A FULL RECOVERY AND DID RETURN TO WORK A COUPLE OF WEEKS FOLLOWING THE INCIDENT. MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH FIELD PERSONNEL AND OTHER APPROPRIATE STAFF AFTER THIS INCIDENT TO DISCUSS AND REVIEW THE EVENT. AFTER A STEP BY STEP REVIEW OF THE INCIDENT, DISCUSSION WERE HELD AROUND WHAT WENT WRONG AND HOW TO PREVENT THIS IN THE FUTURE. TRAINING AND RECERTIFICATION WILL BE CONDUCTED FOR THE EMPLOYEES INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT AS REQUIRED BY CFR 192.605. ALL REVIEWS REQUIRED BY CFR 192.805 FOR COVERED TASKS WERE CONDUCTED AND CONCLUSIONS WERE MADE THAT CHANGES WERE NOT NEEDED TO THE OPERATOR QUALIFICATION PROGRAM FOR THIS TASK.

NASMAN	4134450303	"ON THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 13TH AT APPROXIMATELY 1:50 A.M., BERKSHIRE GAS DISPATCH CENTER RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE TURNERS FALLS POLICE DEPARTMENT REPORTING A FIRE AND EXPLOSION AT THE ABOVE REFERENCED LOCATION. BERKSHIRE IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED ""ON-CALL"" PERSONNEL TO THE SCENE AND WHO ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 2:15 A.M.. UPON BERKSHIRES ARRIVAL, THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HAD EXTINGUISHED THE FIRE IN THE AREA OF MECHANICAL ROOM AND SHUT-OFF THE PROPANE TANKS. THE LOCATION IS SERVED BY BERSKHIRE PROPANE, A BERKSHIRE GAS AFFILIATE. THERE CONTINUED TO BE A ""LAZY"" FLAME (APPROXIMATELY 3 IN DIAMETER) EMANATING FROM THE GROUND IN THE AREA OF THE SERVICE RISER. UPON REVIEW OF THE AREA, BERKSHIRES RESPONDER NOTICED ANOTHER RISER IN THE AREA OF THE SERVICE RISER INDICATING THAT A NATURAL GAS SERVICE MAY BE PRESENT. AT APPROXIMATELY 2:30 A.M. A DISTRIBUTION EMPLOYEE WAS CALLED IN FOR ASSISTANCE. THE DISTRIBUTION EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON-SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 2:45 A.M. SERVICE CARD INFORMATION WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE DISTRIBUTION EMPLOYEES LAPTOP COMPUTER RECORD SYSTEM. THEREFORE TIES TO THE CURB STOP VALVE WAS NOT AVAILABLE. ADDITIONAL CREWS AND EQUIPMENT WAS DISPATCHED IN ORDER TO SQUEEZE-OFF THE SERVICE. SNOW BANKS WERE REMOVED SO AS TO ACCESS THE SERVICE NEAR THE MAIN TEE. UPON EXCAVATION OF THE SERVICE, A ""SQUEEZE-OFF"" TOOL WAS UTILIZED TO SHUT OFF SERVICE AT APPROXIMATELY 4:30 A.M. THE SERVICE LINE IS A 1 1/4 ""POLYETHYLENE SERVICE OPERATING AT 40 PSIG. UPON COMPLETING THE SQUEEZE-OFF, THE GROUND FLAME CEASED. A BERKSHIRE GAS SUPERVISOR WAS REQUESTED AND ARRIVED ON SITE AT APPROXIMATELY 6:30 A.M. BERKSHIRE ALSO REQUESTED THE ASSISTANCE OF FIRE SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY, A FIRE SCIENCE CONSULTING FIRM, TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL FIRE SCIENCE ANALYSIS. BASED ON THE CONDITION PRESENTED, IT WAS DECIDED AT THAT TIME TO CONDUCT A PRESSURE TEST OF THE PROPANE SERVICE LINE, AS WELL AS THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE TO SEE IF EITHER HAD BEEN IMPACTED BY THE LOCALIZED FIRE. AT THE NATURAL GAS SERVICE LINE SQUEEZE-OFF LOCATION, THE CREW CUT THE SERVICE LINE AND FUSED ON A 1 1/4 SERVICE RISER AS A MEANS TO PRESSURE TEST THE LINE WITH NITROGEN. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:30 A.M. THE DISTRIBUTION CREW, PERFORMED THE PRESSURE TEST AND THE SERVICE WAS NOT ABLE TO SUSTAIN PRESSURE. AT THIS POINT IT WAS DECIDED TO EXCAVATE THE SERVICE RISER AT THE BUILDING LOCATION. THE RISER IS A PERFECTION ANODELESS SERVICE RISER WITH A POLYETHYLENE-TO-STEEL TRANSITION. UPON EXCAVATION ON THE RISER, DRIED SOILS, WERE LOCATED AROUND THE AREA OF THE MOISTURE SEAL OF THE PRE-MANUFACTURED ""PERFECTION"" RISER. THE SOIL CONDITIONS ENCOUNTERED IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA SURROUNDING THE MOISTURE SEAL PRESENTED THOSE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A LEAK. PICTURES WERE TAKEN TO DOCUMENT ENCOUNTERED CONDITIONS. THE SERVICE LINE WAS RE-PRESSURE TESTED TO IDENTIFY IF THE RISER WAS THE LEAKAGE SOURCE. THE PRESSURE TEST DID INDICATE THAT LEAKAGE ON THE BOTTOM PORTION OF THE MOISTURE SEAL WAS PRESENT BASED ON VISUAL OBSERVATION AND EMPLOYEES FEELING LEAKAGE ALONG THIS AREA. IT WAS THEN DECIDED TO REMOVE THE SERVICE RISER AND PRESSURE TEST THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE SERVICE LINE TO CHECK ITS INTEGRITY. THE SERVICE RISER WAS REMOVED (CUT) FROM THE SERVICE LINE AT A POINT APPROXIMATELY EIGHT INCHES UPSTREAM OF THE FIELD/MANUFACTURED JOINT. A DEAD END CAP WAS FUSED ONTO THE SERVICE LINE. A PRESSURE TEST WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO TEST THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE SERVICE LINE. THE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AND THE SERVICE LINE MAINTAINED A PRESSURE OF 100 PSIG FOR A 30 MINUTE PERIOD. A PRESSURE RECORDING CHART WAS UTILIZED TO DOCUMENT TEST RESULTS. BASED ON THE FIELD RESULTS, IT IS FELT THE PRE-MANUFACTURED ""PERFECTION"" SERVICE RISER MAY HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE INCIDENT. THE SERVICE RISER WAS TAKEN FROM THE SITE BY BERKSHIRE GAS AND TRANSFERRED OVER TO THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND ENERGY (MADTE) -PIPELINE ENGINEERING AND SAFETY DIVISION WHERE IT CURRENTLY RESIDES. A TESTING LABORATORY HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AND"

INITIALLY, PNM CONSIDERED THIS TO BE A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION (EXCEEDING MAOP) BUT CORRECTABLE WITHIN THE REPORTING PERIOD AND, THEREFORE, NOT REPORTABLE AS A SAFETY RELATED CONDITION.  THE OVER PRESSURE CONDITION WAS BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL WITHIN 2 HOURS.  ON JUNE 20, 2003, UPON THE DISCOVERY OF FIVE (5) GRADE 1 LEAKS WITHIN THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM, PNM MADE THE DECISION THAT THE SAFETY RELATED CONDITION WAS NOW SIGNIFICANT AND REPORTABLE.  WITHIN 54 HOURS OF THE OVERPRESSURE EVENT, A LEAK SURVEY OF THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM WAS COMPLETED.  AN INITIAL LEAK SURVEY WAS STARTED AT 2100 HOURS ON JUNE 18, 2003 AND COMPLETED AT 1800 HOURS ON JUNE 20, 2003.  A SECOND LEAK SURVEY WAS STARTED AT 0600 HOURS ON JUNE 23, 2003 AND COMPLETED AT 1800 HOURS ON JUNE 24, 2003.  ALL KNOWN GRADE 1 AND 2 LEAKS WERE REPAIRED.  A THIRD LEAK SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN MID-JULY 2003."

THERE WAS ONE FATALITY.  CITY UTILITIES PROCEDURES FOR NATURAL GAS EMERGENCIES WERE FOLLOWED AND THE MISSOURI PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION (PSC) WAS NOTIFIED.  GAS WAS SHUT OFF TO THE AREA BY 1:00PM ON JUNE 18.  PSC REPRESENTATIVES ARRIVED ONSITE THAT AFTERNOON.  CONSTRUCTION CREWS, PRESSURE CONTROL PERSONNEL, LEAK INVESTIGATORS, AND ENGINEERING PERSONNEL WORKED ON SITE IN A COORDINATED EFFORT AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE PSC WERE ON SITE MONITORING THE WORK THROUGH JUNE 21, 2003.  SEVERAL READINGS OF GAS IN AIR AND LEL WERE TAKEN IN THE AREA OF THE PIPE, IN THE AREA BETWEEN THE PIPE AND THE BUILDING, AND IN THE BASEMENT AREA OF THE BUILDING.  SAMPLES OF THE AIR WERE ALSO TAKEN.  THIS DATA SHOWED THAT NATURAL GAS WAS IN THE BUILDING.  THE SPRINGFIELD FIRE DEPARTMENT INVESTIGATION RULED THAT THE IGNITION SOURCE WAS A CIGARETTE LIGHTER AND THAT THE FUEL SOURCE WAS NATURAL GAS.  CITY UTILITIES RETAINED A THIRD PARTY INVESTIGATOR WHO WORKED WITH CU PERSONNEL AND THE PSC FROM JUNE 19 JUNE 21 CONDUCTING AN ONSITE INVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE PRESENCE AND LOCATION OF A GAS LEAK.  CITY UTILITIES ONSITE INVESTIGATION DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS A LEAK IN A 2-INCH PLASTIC GAS SERVICE PIPE RUNNING ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE WEST SIDE OF THE BUILDING AT A DISTANCE OF 48 FEET.  THE LEAKING SECTION OF THE 2-INCH ALDYL A PLASTIC PIPE WAS REMOVED FROM THE GROUND FOR TESTING AND AFTER THE LINE HAD BEEN CUT IN SECTIONS FOR PRESSURE TESTING IT WAS PURGED OF GAS, CAPPED AND RETIRED.  IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH EXTREMES OF THE EXCAVATION THAT WAS MADE TO TEST AND REMOVE THE LEAKING SECTION OF THE PIPE, SAND BACKFILL COULD BE OBSERVED AROUND THE PIPE.  IN THE AREA OF THE LEAKING SECTION THE SAND BACKFILL WAS DISCONTINUOUS AND THERE WAS CONSTRUCTION DEBRIS AROUND THE PIPE.  THERE WAS A ROCK IMPINGEMENT UNDER THE PIPE STRESSING THE PIPE AT THE POINT OF FAILURE.  THE ORIGIN OF THE DEBRIS AND ROCK ARE NOT KNOWN.  THE DAMAGE COULD BE DESCRIBED AS A TOTAL COLLAPSE OF THE FRISCO BUILDING.  THE EAST WALL OF THE BASEMENT WAS BUCKLED INWARD.  THE BUILDING AND ITS CONTENTS WERE A TOTAL LOSS.  DEBRIS WAS SCATTERED WELL INTO THE PARKING LOT WEST OF THE FRISCO BUILDING.  THERE WERE ALSO DAMAGES TO BUILDINGS SURROUNDING THE FRISCO BUILDING."

THE 3/4 INCH GAS SERVICE TO 178 VALLEY ROAD, HILLSBOROUGH WAS SHUT OFF AT 3:50 PM.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE 3/4 INCH INSULATOR WAS ""CHARRED"".  THE INSULATOR WAS REPLACED, THE SERVICE WAS PRESSURE TESTED AT 90 PSIG, AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE CUSTOMER.  AN EXCAVATION WAS MADE OVER THE MAIN CONNECTION FOR THE 3/4 INCH SERVICE THAT SUPPLIES 432 ROYCEFIELD ROAD.  INVESTIGATION FOUND THAT THE GASKET OF A DRESSER COMPRESSION COUPLING WAS BURNED.  PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT A LIGHTNING STRIKE OCCURRED CAUSING THE ""B"" PHASE, CONDUCTOR SIZE 397, OF A 13 KV SPACER CABLE DISTRIBUTION CIRCUIT TO FALL TO THE GROUND.  IT IS FELT THAT THIS CONDUCTOR OR THE DISCHARGE OF THE LIGHTNING THROUGH THE GROUNDING SYSTEM CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO THE ABOVE MENTIONED INSULATOR AND COMPRESSION COUPLING.

A DISTRIBUTION SUPERVISOR WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED, ARRIVED AT THE SCENE AT 1:15 PM, AND FOUND THAT INTER COUNTY PAVING WAS RECONSTRUCTING THE ROADWAY AND IN THE PROCESS OF DOING SO, DAMAGED A WATER MAIN.  WHILE EXCAVATING TO ADDRESS THE BROKEN WATER MAIN THEY STRUCK THE 6 INCH, 15 PSIG, STEEL GAS MAIN WITH THEIR TRACK HOE AND PUNCTURED THE MAIN WITH A TOOTH OF THE BUCKET.  FOLLOWING THE DAMAGE THE ESCAPING GAS IGNITED, AND BURNED THE OVERHEAD ELECTRIC, TELEPHONE AND CABLE WIRES AND EXTENSIVELY DAMAGED THE TRACK HOE.  POLICE AND FIRE RESPONDERS CLOSED THE ROAD DURING THE INCIDENT.  INITIAL INVESTIGATION INDICATES THAT A PUMP NEAR THE EXCAVATION THAT WAS USED TO DEWATER THE WORK SITE IS THE PROBABLE SOURCE OF IGNITION.  SINCE THE INITIAL DOLLAR VALUE OF ALL DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIS INCIDENT APPEARS TO EXCEED $50,000, THE OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY WAS NOTIFIED.  (OPS REPORT NUMBER 656941) A BY-PASS WAS INSTALLED AROUND THE DAMAGE SECTION OF MAIN AND THE FIRE WAS EXTINGUISHED BY 9:25 PM ALLOWING THE REMOVAL OF THE TRACK HOE AND THE INITIATION OF REPAIRS.

The event happened while O&M personnel was working in the replacement of LNG Pump P-101C. While the pump was being removed from the tank column and traveling to its transportation frame, supported by the LNG Tank Top Crane, O&M personnel noticed a small fire in the bottom suction notch of the pump. Immediately, EcoElectrica Maintenance Technicians proceeded to extinguish the fire using portable ABC fire extinguishers located at the LNG Tank Top Platform. No personnel was injured or equipment damaged during the incident. At 15:37hrs (two minutes later), a LNG Sendout pump was returned to operation and at 15:41hrs LNG vaporization process was reestablished and terminal recovered for normal operation.     The root cause of the ignition was a static electricity discharge. After a Nitrogen purge of more than 12 hours, the pump was ready to be removed from its well. Due to strong gust of winds, prior to lifting  the pump, a polypropylene rope was tied to one of the stands of the bottom suction notch as an aid to control pump movements while being transferred from the well to the transportation frame. During this maneuver the technician attending the pump was using skin gloves while the propylene rope was being controlled with his hands creating friction between the two materials. The gloves' material (leather) in contact with the rope (Polypropylene) gave rise to accumulations of electric charge that was released suddenly in electrostatic discharges with sufficient energy to ignite the flammable gas mix present at the pump notch. The first step on the ignition is the production of a spark that instantly generates IR light (Corona effect) that was captured by the flame detector which triggered the ESD #1."

Debris from the rupture penetrated the outer wall of one of two LNG storage tanks. Natural Gas vented from the vapor space between the inner and outer walls of the storage tank but did not ignite.    Station personnel immediately executed an ESD of the facility. Of 5 employees taken to the hospital for evaluation, 4 employees were treated and released and 1 employee was admitted for burn injuries and released several days later.      A third party investigation firm was contracted to document the incident location and manage all evidence.  Various consultants were engaged in the completion of an incident investigation.  The investigation determined the leading cause was the presence of a fuel/air mixture remaining in the system following maintenance activities. The fuel/air mix then auto-ignited within the system piping upon startup when the flammable mixture entered the inlet of a salt bath heater."

Information indicates the cause of the flash fire was a catastrophic failure of a fuel run regulator located on the vaporizer trailer. The regulator failure caused multiple relief valves to exhaust gas to the atmosphere which was ignited by the water/glycol heater burners located on the vaporizer trailer. Two employees were examined at a nearby hospital and released back to full duty. They both had sunburn like injuries.    Northern had placed this temporary / portable LNG tanker and vaporizer tailer at the Benson, Minnesota town border station as a contingency while work was being conducted upstream at the Alexandria, Minnesota compressor station. The tanker and vaporizer had been connected to the Benson town border station since 12/27/2013 but wasn't in-service until the morning of 12/31/2013. The water bath heaters on the vaporizer trailer were lit but LNG was not being delivered. On 12/31/2013, the pipeline gas pressure was low enough to test the LNG delivery. The delivery was just beginning to come on when the regulator failed and the flash fire occurred. The town of Benson, Minnesota was never in danger of losing natural gas service."

On-site personnel responded appropriately and returned the plant to Hold Mode and verified safe conditions.  There was a small cycling release of CO2 from a vessel through its relief valve for a period of about 20 minutes.  Further research over the next 24 hours confirmed the primary cause of the event as the failure of an Allen-Bradley PLC-5/40E processor board.  This PLC was programmed as the control PLC for the plant liquefaction process.  A replacement PLC was procured and delivered to the plant on Wednesday November 7, 2012.  The liquefaction PLC program was reloaded into the new processor and its functionality was verified that same day.  The plant was declared back in service by noon Wednesday November 7, 2012."

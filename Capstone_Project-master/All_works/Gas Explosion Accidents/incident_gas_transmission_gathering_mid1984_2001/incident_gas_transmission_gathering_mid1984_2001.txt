FIVE EMPLOYEES WERE PREPARING TO LAY CONCRETE FOR AN AIR COMPRESSOR IN THE SOUTH END OF ONE OF THE BUILDINGS ON SITE, THE ORIFICE METER BUILDING.  THREE 10-INCH METER RUNS ARE LOCATED IN THE ORIFICE METER BUILDING.  THERE ARE ALSO TWO GAS CHROMATOGRAPHS IN THIS BUILDING.  AN ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE WAS ON SITE, WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR OPERATING AND MAINTAINING THE MECHANICAL, ELECTRONIC AND MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT AT THIS STATION.  THIS EMPLOYEE WAS DOING WORK IN THE ORIFICE METER BUILDING, PRESUMABLY ON THE CHROMATOGRAPHS, AND IN THE INSTRUMENTATION BUILDING, WHICH IS LOCATED ABOUT 15 FEET DIRECTLY NORTH OF THE ORIFICE METER BUILDING.  THIS EMPLOYEE'S PRECISE ACTIONS ON THE SITE ARE UNKNOWN SINCE HE DIED IN THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE.  WITNESSES HAVE INDICATED THAT THE ORIFICE FITTING IN THE MIDDLE 10-INCH METER RUN WAS OPEN AND THE ORIFICE PLATE HOLDER WAS IN AN EXTENDED POSITION BEFORE THE INCIDENT.  THE REASON THAT THIS FITTING WAS OPEN AND HOLDER EXTENDED IS UNKNOWN.  THE MANUAL PLUG VALVEWHICH SEPARATES THE UPPER AND LOWER CHAMBERS OF THIS ORIFICE FITTING WAS FOUND IN A HALF-OPEN POSITION WHEN VIEWED AFTER THE INCIDENT. IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THEINCIDENT, THE DECEASED EMPLOYEE ASKED FOUR EMPLOYEES WHO WERE ON SITE AT THE TIME TO LEAVE THE ORIFACE METER BUILDING BECAUSE HE WAS GOING TO DO SOME WORK THATENTAILED NOISE. THE DECEASED EMPLOYEE THEN WENT INTO THE INSTRUMENTATION BUILDING AND IT IS THEORIZED THAT HE PROCEEDED TO OPERATE THE STATION CONTROLS. THE VALVE ON THE NORTHERN MOST METER RUN OPENED AND THE VALVE ON THE MIDDLE METER RUN MOVED TPA HAL-OPEN POSITION ALLOWING GAS TO ENTER THAT METER RUN AND THEN TO ESCAPE THROUGH THE OPEN ORIFICE FITTING WHERE THE ORIFICE PLATE HOLDER WAS EXTENDED. THE SOURCE OF IGNITION IS UNKNOWN BUT ACCORDING TO WITNESSES, WITHIN SECONDS OF THE GAS STARTING TO ESCAPE, THERE WAS AN EXPLOSION AND FIRE. THE BODY OF THE EMPLOYEE KILLED IN THE EXPLOSION AND FIRE WAS FOUND IN THE INSTRUMENTATION BUILDING. THE FOUR OTHER EMPLOYEES ON SITE AT THE TIME WERE BURNED BEFORE THEY LEFT THE SITE. ANOTHER EMPLOYEE ARRIVED ON SITE SHORTLY AFTER THE INCIDENT AND PROCEEDED TO SHUT OFF THE SOURCE OF GAS WHICH WAS FEEDING THE FIRE BY CLOSING THE APPROPRIATE VALVES. THIS EMPLOYEE SUSTAINED BURNS WHILE CLOSING THE VALVES. THE HEBRON, NORTH DAKOTA FIRE DEPARTMENT EXTINGUISHED THE SECONDARY FIRES IN THE INSTRUMENT BUILDING AND IN TWO VEHICLES PARKED ADJACENT TO THE INSTRUMENT BUILDING."

IGNITION DID NOT OCCUR, HOWEVER, SERVICE WAS INTERUPTED TO THREE DOMESTIC AND ONE COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR HOURS. THE LEAK WAS CAUSED BY AN OUTSIDE PARTY OPERATING A MOTOR-GRADER WHILE PUTTING PIRT OVER OUR PIPELINE TO MAKE A FIELD ENTRANCE. KN WAS NOT NOTIFIED OF THE PROPOSED EARTH-MOVING ACTIVITY. THE OPERATOR OF THE MOTOR-GRADER WAS TAKEN TO A LOCAL HOSPITAL FOR OBSERVATION AT APPROXIMATELY 2:20 PM ON APRIL 22, 1985 AND RELEASEDAT 6:30 PM ON THE SAME DAY WITH NO APPARENT INJURIES. THE DAMAGED PORTION OF PIPLINE IS IN A CLASS I LOCATION, MARKED WITH PERMANENT MARKERS, ONE A LARGE AERIAL MARKER IS EASILY VISIBLE 354 FEET WEST OF THE INCIDENT.

WHEN THE FIRE CONTINUED TO BURN AND OBVIOUSLY WAS BEING FED BY SOME TYPE OF GAS,THE OWNER OF THE PROPERTY NOTIFED SOMERSET ON THE AFTERNOON OF FRIDAY, MAY 3RD.SOMERSET'S MAIN EAST KENTUCKY TRANSMISSION LINE PASSES WITHIN TWENTY FIVE FEET OF THE PROPERTY. THE HOUSE WAS RELOCATED CLOSER TO SOMERSET'S PIPELINE AFTER SOMERSET CONSTRUCTED THE PIPELINE. UPON ARRIVAL AT THE SCENE, THE SOMERSET GAS SERVICE DECIDED TO DEPRESSURIZE THE LINE TO ATTEMPT TO DISCOVER THE SOURCE OF THE GAS. AT APPROXIMATELY 2:30 AM, SATURDAY, MAY 4TH, SOMERSET COMPLETELY DEPRESSURIZED THE LINE, BUT THE GAS FLAMES AT THE RESIDENCE CONTINUED. THE GAS FED FLAMES ATTHE RESIDENCE CONTINUED TO BURN MORE THAN TWELVE HOURS LATER, AS SOMERSET'S CREWS WORKED TOWARD UNCOVERING THE TRANSMISSION LINE AT THE LOCATION. EXCAVATION OFSOMERSET'S TRANSMISSION LINE REVEALED THE LOCATION OF A POSSIBLE LEAK, WHICH WAS A RESULT OF EXTERNAL FORCES WHICH OCCURED AFTER THE INITIAL CONSTRUCTION OF SOMERSET'S PIPELINE.

WHILE SOMERSET'S PIPELINE WAS FOUND TO LEAK,APPARENTLY DUE TO DAMAGE BY A STRIP MINING OPERATION, THE SOURCE OF THECONTINUED FLOW OF GAS AT THE HOUSE SITE IS UNKNOWN. THE CONTINUED FLOW CANNOTBE FROM SOMERSET'S PIPELINE BECAUSE THE ENTIRE SECTION WAS RETESTED AT HIGHPRESSURE AFTER REPAIR.

NO OTHER WORK WAS DONE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF THE OUTRAGE PRIOR TO JUNE 14, 1985. AT 1:30 A.M. ON JUNE 14, 1985 THE 8"" LINE FAILED DUE TO THE 8"" PIPE PULLING OUT OF THE MECHANICALCOUPLING.

THE LINE PIPE MATERIAL WAS 12 3/4"" O.D.,27.20#(0.203""),API-5LX., X-42 ERW MANUFACTURED BY LONE STAR STEEL. THE LINE WAS HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED TO 1100 PSIG FOR FOUR HOURS, WHICH ESTABLISHED AN MAOP OF 720 PSIG IN A CLASS 2 LOCATION. DUE TO THE SUPPLY TO THIS SYSTEM AND NO NEED FOR THE720 PSIG PRESSURE TO SERVE MARKET, THE PIPELINE HAS OPERATED AT 300 TO 350 PSIGSINCE INSTALLATION. THE NEED FOR 50O PSIG MAXIMUM OPERATING PRESSURE ON THIS PIPELINE IS NOW REQUIRED TO SERVE MARKET. SINCE THE LINE HAD NOT OPERATED HIGHER THAN 350 PSIG. IT WAS DECIDED TO GO THROUGH AN UPRATING PROCEDURE. A WRITTEN PLANWAS PREPARED AS PER SUBPART K OF THE D.O.T. RULES. THE PRESSURE IS TO BE INCREASED IN 100 PSIG INCREMENTS TO 750 (500 X 1.5) WITH A FLAME-IONIZATION LEAK SURVEY DURING THE 24-HOUR HOLD PERIOD. THE LINE RUPTURED AT 55O PSIG, WHICH WAS THE SECOND STEP OF THE PRESSURE INCREASES. THE 550 PSIG WAS ATTAINED AT ABOUT 1600 HOURS ON DECEMBER 2, 1986, AND THE LINE FAILED AT 1930 HOURS ON DECEMBER 2, 1986. NO FIRE, NO FATALITIES. AND NO INJURIES RESULTED FROM THE RUPTURE.

THE TWO OPERATING UNITS AND DEPARTMENT DIRECTLY INVOLVED TRANSPORTATION OPERATIONS, TRANSMISSION DEPARTMENT AND THE GAS CONTROL DEPARTMENT.INTERDEPARTMENTAL INVESTIGATION AND DISCUSSIONS ENSUED IMMEDIATELY AFTER DISCOVERY OF THE PRESSURE DROP.  IT WAS ERRONEOUSLY DECIDED, AT THAT TIME, THAT THE PRESSURE DROP WAS DUE TO A FAULTY PRESSURE TRANSMITTER.  THIS TRANSMITTER HAS HAD A HISTORY OF OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE PROBLEMS AND WAS SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED.OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE EXTENDED RESPONSE TIME WERE:1.  REMOTE LOCATION.  SINCE THE RUPTURE IS LOCATED IN A U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED AREA, THERE WERE NO PUBLIC ROADS OPEN OR HOUSES IN THE GENERAL VICINITY - NO ONE COULD HEAR OR SEE THE ESCAPING NATURAL GAS.2. THE NATURAL GAS DIDNOT IGNITE.3. THE RUPTURE OCCURED IN THE EVENING DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEDEND. THERE WERE NO EQUITABLE PERSONNEL NOR DAM CONSTRUCTION WORKERS IN THE AREA TO HEAR OR WITNESS THE ESCAPING NATURAL GAS. ALSO, SINCE DEER HUNTING SEASON CLOSED THE EVENING OF DECEMBER 5, 1987, THERE WERE NO HUNTERS IN THE AREA.4. THE CAUSE OF THE WELD FAILURE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION. ALL OXY-ACETYLENE WELDED PIPE IN THE SKIN CREEK STORAGE POOL IS SCHEDULED TO BE REPLACED ASSOON AS POSSIBLE.CONSTRUCTION IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY TO REPLACE ALL OXY-ACETYLENE PIPE IN THE POOL.

ADDITIONALLY, A CHEMICAL ANALYSIS F THE ATMOSPHERE INSIDE TH COLD BOX WAS MADE AFTER THE INCIDENT, BUT PRIOR TO THE INTERNAL INSPECTION.  THIS ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT IN SOME PARTS OF THE COLD BOX THAT THERE WERE SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF OXYGEN (FROM AIR), ETHYLENE AND NATURAL GAS CONSTITUENTS PRESENT TO SUPPORT A LIMITED REGION OF COMBUSTION.  IT IS BELIEVED THAT ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE NATURAL GAS INTERMITTENLY LEAKING FROM FLANGES ON EXCHANGERS E-8AND /OR E-9 IN THE COLD BOX AND AIR ENTERED THE COLD BOX DUE TO POOR PERFORMANCE OF THE NITROGEN PRUGE SYSTEM. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DIRECT EVIDENCE AS TO WHAT CAUSED THE DAMAGE TO THE COLD BOX,ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT A DEFLAGRATION OR MILD EXPLOSION PROBABLY OCCURRED IN A SMALL PORTION OF THE COLD BOX SPACE.

THE FIRST  EMPLOYEE AT THE SCENE EXTINGUISHED THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRE.  THE PROBABLE CAUSE OF THE FIRE WAS A STEEL REINFORCED FLEX LINE/FITTING FAILURE THAT SPRAYED NATRUAL GAS AND SEAL OIL ONTO THE HOT POWER TURBINE SECTION OF THE COMPRESSOR.  THIS VIEW IS SUPPORTED BY THE PATTERN OF DESTRUCTION.  THE MOST SEVERE DAMAGE OCCURRED ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE EXHAUST STACK BETWEEN THE POWER TURBINE & GAS COMPRESSOR.  THE ESAST HALF OF THE SEAL OIL TANK WAS SEVERLY CHARRED. AT THAT TANK, THE REFERENCE GAS LINE TO THE SEAL OIL LEVEL SWITCH WAS FOUND SEPERATED.IT WAS AS IF THE FLEX LINE SEGMENT PULLED OUT OF ITS OWN CONNECTOR.  IF SO, THE UPPER OPENING RELEASED HIGH PRESSURE GAS AND THE LOWER OPENING RELEASED THE SEAL OIL.  BOTH MEDIA WOULD HAVE SPILLED DIRECTLY ON THE STILL HOT,POWER TURBINE CASING.  IT SHOULD     BE NOTED, THAT EVEN THOUGH THE UNIT WAS SHUT DOWN AT THE TIME OF IGNITION OF THE FIRE, THE SEALOIL WAS STILL BEING PUMPED AND GAS WAS STILL IN THE UNIT PIPING, AND THE POWERTURBINE EXTERNAL SHIELD MAY HAVE BEEN AS HOT AS 1500F.

BILL GARDNER SHUT IN THE VALVE AT THE NICHOLASVILLE TOWN BORDER STATION DISRUPTING NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO APPROXIMATELY 900 CUSTOMERS IN THE WILMORE SYSTEM.  TWENTY-FOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES FROM DELTA'S NORTHERN & SOUTHERN DIVISIONS WERE DISPATCHED TO WILMORE IN ORDER TO EXPEDITE RESTORATION OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE TO THE AFFECTED CUSTOMERS.  THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES TURNED THE GAS OFF AT EACH METER.  DELTA'S NORTHERN CONSTRUCTION CREW REPAIRED THE PIPELINE BY REPLACING A TWO FOOT SECTION OF SIX-INCH STEEL PIPE.  REPAIRS WERE COMPLETE BY 2:30 P.M. THE PIPELINE WAS THEN PURGED AND ENERGIZED.  NATURAL GAS SERVICE HAD BEEN RESTORED TO APROXIMATELY 800 CUSTOMERS BY 11:00 P.M. THAT EVENING.  THE REMAINING 100 CUSTOMERS WERE RELIT THE NEXT DAY BEGINNING AT 7:00 A.M.  GTE WAS INSTALLING AN ANCHOR FOR A TELEPHONE POLE WHEN THEY HIT WHATTHEY THOUGHT WAS ROCK.  THEY CONTACTED DRIFTWOOD INC. FOR ASSISTANCE.  DRIFTWOOD DRILLED THROUGH OUR PIPELINE WITH A CARBIDE TIP AUGER.  GTE DID NOT CALLDELTA'S OFFICE FOR LINE LOCATION.  DELTA HAD LINE MARKER POSTS ON EACH SIDE OF THE HIGHWAY MARKING THE ROAD CROSSING UNDER THE BY-PASS.  THE FIRST LINE MARKER POST WAS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET FROM WHERE GTE WAS WORKING.SEVERAL OF DELTA'S YELLOW FLAGS WERE PRESENT WHERE THE LINE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY LOCATED IN KIMBERLY HEIGHTS SUBDIVISION.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS INCIDENT."

THE PIPELINE WAS BLOWN DOWNFROM VALVE 21 TO VALVE 23 (APPRO. 20 MILES).PART C - THE FRACTURE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A LONGITUDINAL SEAM OR A GIRTHWELD. THE FRACTURE FACE EXHIBITED BRITTLE FEATURES (FLAT FRACTURE WITH CHEVRON MARKINGS) THAT POINTED BACK TO AN AREA APPROXIMATELY 5 INCHES LONG, APPROXIMATELY 9 FEET FROM THE UP STREAM FRACTURED END. THIS AREA MAY HAVE BEEN THE INITIATION SITE, SINCE THE PIECE WAS CLEARLY BENT WITH A RUPTURED AND TORN HOLE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BEND.  THE PIECE CONTAINED A WRINKLE BEND ON ITS UPSTREAM SIDE THAT EITHER WAS IN THE ORIGINAL PIPELINE OR WAS CAUSED BY TH RUPTURE. THE WRINKLE EXHIBITED A BRITTLE FRACTURE SURFACE WITH MANY CRACKS IN AND AROUND THE BEND.  ULTRASONIC, MAGNETIC PARTICLE AND HARDNESS TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON THE POSSIBLE INITIATION SITE.  THESE TESTS CONFIRMED A WALL THICKNESSOF .345 TO .350 INCHES. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL CORROSION.  HARDNESS TESTING VERIFIED THAT THE AREA AROUND THE POSSIBLE RUPTURE INITIATION SITE WAS 38 HRC INDICATING THAT HYDROGEN STRESS CRACKING OF THE ""HARDSPOT"" WAS THE CAUSE OF THE FAILURE."

THE RESULTS OF THE METALURGICAL ANALYSIS MAY REVEAL MORE FACTS THAT WILL HELP DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE INCIDENT,  REPORT NUMBER 130311.ON AUGUST 2, 1992 FERGUSON-BURLESON COUNTY GAS GATHERING SYSTEM, A SUBSIDIARY OF SOUTHWESTERN GAS PIPELINE, INC., EXPERIENCE A FIRE AT AN UNATTENDED FIELD GAS GATHERING COMPRESSOR SITE KNOWN AS THE STEEPHOLLOW #5, LOCATED ON BIRD POND RD APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES WEST OF HWY 30 AND 3.5 MILES SOUTH SOUTHEAST OFCOLLEGE STATION, TEXAS IN BRAZOS COUNTY.  THE INCIDENT WAS DISCOVERED AT 9:30AM AND WAS REPORTED TO THE 24 HOUR EMERGENCY NUMBER AT 10:40 AM.  THIS NOTIFICATION WAS MADE DUE TO THE AREA WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED AND THE ESTIMATED DOLLAR AMOUNT OF DAMAGE.  THE STEEPHPLLOW #5 COMPRESSOR SITE IS LOCATED IN A RURAL, CLASS 1 LOCATION APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES FROM A DWELLING INTENDED FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY.  THERE WERE NO PERSONNEL INJURED OR KILLED.  THE FIRE WAS CONTAINED BY 10:30 AM AND THE REMAINING COMPRESSORS WERE BACK IN OPERATION BY 2:30 PM.  THERE WAS NO LOSS OF GAS SERVICE SINCE THE SUBJECT GATHERING LINE SERVES ANOTHER PART OF THE OPERATORS GAS PROCESSING FACILITIES DOWNSTREAM OF THIS LOCATION.  THE ESTIMATED PROPERTY DAMAGE IS $500,000.00.  THIS IS A REPLACEMENT COST OF THE COMPRESSOR AND A $1,000.00 VALUE OF THE GAS LOST.  THE COSTESTIMATE WAS DETERMINED THE DAY AFTER THE INCIDENT, THEREFORE, THIS INCIDENTWAS REPORTED TO THE NTSB EMERGENCY RESPONSE CENTER ON TUESDAY, AUHUST 4, 1992.  MR.  CHUCK KOVALL ASSIGNED THE RSPA INCIDENT REPORT NUMBER, 130311, AT THAT TIME.  SHORTLY AFTER REPORTING THE INCIDENT TO THE NTSB IN WASHINGTON, MR. R.G. (BOB) HOLTER WITH THE RSPA IN HOUSTON CALLED AND I REPORTED THE CHAIN OF EVENTS AND SPECIFIC DETAILS TO HIM.  MR. HOLTER INDICATED TO ME THAT SINCENO ONE WAS INJURED OR KILLED, THE GENERAL PUBLIC WAS NOT AFFECTED,  THE FACILITIES ARE INTRASTATE AND ARE RURAL GATHERING, HE DID NOT BELIEVE HIS SUPERVISORS WOULD HAVE HIM INVESTIGATE.  I INFORMED MR. HOLTER THAT THE INCIDENT HADBEEN REPORTED TO THE RAILROAD COMMISSION AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT AND MR.DANNY NICHOLS, ENGINEERING TECHNICIAN, FROM THE RRC'S HOUSTON OFFICE INVESTIGATED THE INCIDENT ON SITE.  AFTER A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION OF THE EQUIPMENT,IT APPEARS THAT A VALVE COVER HAD BLOWN OFF, SHEARING THE BOLTS THAT HELD ITON THE SECOND STAGE CYLINDER RELEASING GAS TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  THIS COULD HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF IGNITION, HOWEVER,  THE ACTUAL SOURCE HAS NOT ACTUALLY BEEN DETERMINED.  FERGUSON-BURLESON'S INSURANCE CARRIER REQUESTED THAT THE COMPRESSOR PACKAGE ASSEMBLER TAKE THE UNIT TO THEIR SHOP AND DISASSEMBLE IT TO TDETERMINE WHAT IF ANYTHING IS SALVAGEABLE, WHICH WILL HAVE A DIRECT AFFECT ON THE ACTUAL COST OF REPLACEMENT.  THE SHEARED BOLTS HAVE BEEN SENT TO A METALURHIST'S FOR ANALYSIS, THE RESULTS OF WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN RECIEVED.  SHOULD THE RESULTS OF THESE EXAMINATIONS CHANGE THE COST ESTIMATE SIGNIFICANTLY AND THE METALURGIST'S REPORT REVEAL SOMETHING NEW,  A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE COMPLETED AND FORWARDED PROMPTLY.  THE DAMAGED COMPRESSR UNIT IS BEING PREPARED FOR SHIPMENT TO THE PACKAGER FOR INSPECTION ON AUGUST 19, 1992, TO BESHIPPED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE."

THE LOCATION OF THE ENID POWER PLANT REGULATOR STATION IS GARFIELD COUNTY, OKLAHOMA, SECTION 19, TOWNSHIP 22 NORTH, RANGE 6 WEST.  THE AREA IS PRIMARILY RURAL WITH A FEW INDUSTRAIL BUILDINGS IN THE AREA.  DAMAGE TO SURROUNDING BUILDINGS WAS MAINLY BLOWN OUT WINDOWS, LOOSE LIGHT FIXTURES AND MINOR EXTERIOR DAMAGE, ALTHOUGH ONE BUILDING DIDRECEIVE MODERATE INTERIOR DAMAGE.  OUR STATION PIPING AND COMPONENTS DID RECEIVE EXTENSIVE DAMAGE IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA WHERE THE STORAGE TANK WAS LOCATED.  THE INLET SEPARATOR DUMP VALVE MALFUNCTIONED, CAUSING THE VALVE TO OPEN.IT APPEARS THAT LIQUIDS IN THE EXTERNAL FLOAT DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER BEGAN TO FREEZE AND EXPAND.  THIS CAUSED THE DISPLACER TO RISE, SENDING SUPPLY GAS TO THE DUMP VALVE, WHICH THEN BEGAN TO OPEN.  WITH THE DISPLACER FROZEN IN A RAISED POSITION, THE DUMP VALVE REMAINED PARTIALLY OR FULLY OPEN, DUMPING WHAT LIQUID WAS IN THE SEPARATOR INTO THE STORAGE TANK AND THEN ALLOWED HIGH PRESSURE GAS TO FILL THE STORAGE TANK, INCREASING ITS INTERNAL PRESSUREEE.  THE RELIEF VALVE WAS OPEN AND RELIEVING CONTINOUSLY. AS THE RESULT OF THE LOW AMBIENTAIR TEMPERATURES OF 25 DEGRESS F, HYDRATES FORMED WHICH PLUGGED OFF THE RELIEF VALVE, CAUSING PRESSURE IN THE TANK TO INCREASE UNTIL THE TANK RUPTURED.  THE RELIEF VALVE WAS SET AT 35 PSIG AND THE OPERATING PRESSURE OF THE STORAGETANK WAS 30 PSIG.  ALTHOUGH THE RELIEF VALVE WAS SET 5 PSIG ABOVE THE STORAGE TANK'S OPERATING PRESSURE, WE DO NOT FEEL THIS CONTRIBUTED TO THE RUPTURE.OWEVER, THIS FINDING DID RAISE A CONCERN ON OUR PART OF THE QUALITY OF WORK BEING DONE BY THE CONTRACTOR PERFORMING RELIEF VALVE TESTING.

RESPONSE:  UPON NOTIFICATION THAT DAMAGE TO THE PIPELINE HAD OCCURRED, THE SELKIRK COGEN PROJECT OPERATOR MADE ARRANGEMENTS TO ENTER THE EXCAVATION FOR A CLOSER EVALUATION OF THE DAMAGE.  THE EXCAVATION WAS ENTERED AND THE DAMAGE WAS INSPECTED BY THE OPERATOR AND BECHTEL CONSTRUCTION AT APPROXIMATELY 13:00 SEVERAL DENTS AND GOUGES OF THE OUTSIDE SURFACE OF THE PIPE WAS FOUND.  THE DAMAGES AREAS WERE MEASURED AND THE PHOTOS WERE TAKEN.  THE PIPE WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN SEVERAL DENTS,THE LARGEST OF WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY 5/8 INCH DEEP.  THE DAMAGE WAS WITHIN3 FEET OF PIPELINE WELD NUMBER W4.  FOLLOWING THE INSPECTION, THE DECISION WAS MADE TO IMMEDIATELY DEPRESSURIZE THE LINE TO ALLOW REPAIR OF THE DAMAGE.  THE MAIN ISOLATION VALVE WAS CLOSED AT 16:43.  THE PIPELINE WAS ALLOWED TO DEPRESSURIZE BY CONSUMPTION OF THE GAS IN THE PACKAGE BOILERS ON THE COGEN SITEELIMINATING THE NEED TO VENT THE GAS TO ATMOSPHERE.  THE GAS LINE PRESSURE HAD BLEED DOWN AND THE COGEN ISOLATION VALVE WAS CLOSED AT 20:15.  SKIBACK PIPELINE CO.

GAS ESCAPING FROM THE RUPTURE IGNITED NEAR THE WEST BANK OF THE RIVER. VALVES UPSTREAM AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE RIVER CROSSING WERE CLOSED AND FIRE BURNEDOUT AT 12:15 PM. THE PIPELINE PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF THE RUPTURE WAS 750 PSIG. GAS FLOW IN LINE 200 WAS DIVERTED TO ADJACENT PIPELINES. MISSISSIPPI RIVERTRAFFIC WAS STOPPED BY MEMPHIS COAST GUARD FOR 3 HOURS. AT THE TIME OF THISINCIDENT, THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WAS AT FLOOD STAGE AND HAS REMAINED AT OR NEAR FLOOD STAGE SINCE THE TIME. FOR THIS REASON, IT HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT A COMPLETE INVESTIGATION OF THIS INCIDENT  TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE. UNDERWATER ELECTRONIC SCANNING DEVICES HAVE BEEN USED TO LOCATE THE RUPTURED PIPELINE. THE CROSSING CONSISTS OF TWO 24 INCH PIPELINES. SCAN DATA SHOWSTHAT THE RUPTURE OCCURRED IN THE NORTH LINE. APPROXIMATELY 1500 FEET OF PIPEIN THREE SECTIONS ARE OUT OF THE DITCH AND LYING ACROSS THE SOUTH LINE. INVESTIGATION OF THE INCIDENT IS CONTINUING, AS RIVER CONDITIONS PERMIT, EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO RECOVER THE PIPE IN ORDER TO DETERMINE A POSSIBLE CAUSE OF THEFAILURE. AT SUCH TIME AS A PROBABLE CAUSE IS DETERMINED, A SUPPLEMENTAL REPORT WILL BE SUBMITTED.  SUPPLEMENTAL 2/29/94 - FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THISINCIDENT HAS REVEALED THAT THE RUPTURED PIPELINE IS ON THE RIVER BOTTOM AT ADEPTH OF APPROX. 80 FEET.

UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION SMALL BUBBLES WERE FOUND RISING TO THE SURFACE OF THE WATER. USING AN UNDERWATER CAMERA MOUNTED ON A REMOTE OPERATED VEHICLE (ROV) IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE BUBBLES WERE ORIGINATING FROM THE SEA FLOOR IMMEDIATELY ABOVE A BURIED SUBSEA TEE AND VALVE ASSEMBLY IN APPROXIMATELY 70 FEET OF WATER. THIS ASSEMBLY HAD BEEN INSTALLED DURING ORIGINAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE MAINLINE  IN 1991 TO CONNECT A FUTURE CUSTOMER. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE LEAKWAS MINIMAL AND IT WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO PRESENT A SAFETY HAZARD TO THE PUBLIC. THE ACTUAL DATE AND TIME THAT THE LEAK ORIGINATED IS UNKNOWN. THE OPERATING PRESSURE OF THE MAINLINE AT POINT AND TIME OF DISCOVERY WAS APPROXIMATELY 800 PSIG. A WORK BOAT AND DIVING CREW WERE MOBILIZED ON SEPTEMBER 26, 1993, AND BEGAN EFFORTS TO UNCOVER THE VALVE ASSEMBLY THE NEXT DAY. AFTER THE ASSEMBLY WAS UNCOVERED IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SOURCE OF THE LEAKAGE WAS A GREASE FITTING ON THE DOWNSTREAM SEAT OF A 16"" BALL VALVE. THE CAP ON THE GREASE FITTING WAS MISSING THE BALL CHECKS IN THE FITTING WERE ALLOWING A SMALL AMOUNT OF GAS TO ESCAPE. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THE CAP WAS NEVER REPLACED AFTER VALVE WAS SERVICED FOLLOWING FINAL HYDROSTATIC TEST IN 1991. THE LEAK WAS REPAIRED BY REPLACING THE CAP ON THE GREASE FITTING. REPAIR ACTIVITIES WERE COMPLETED AND THE ASSEMBLY BACKFILLED ON OCTOBER 6, 1993. THIS LEAK IS BEING REPORTEDBECAUSE THE COST OF MOBILIZING AND OPERATING THE MARINE VESSEL TO SUPPORT THE REPAIR CREW OF SUBSEA WORK IS EXPECTED TO EXCEED $50,000. THERE WAS NO PROPERTY DAMAGE AND THE COST OF GAS LOST WAS MINIMAL. TELEPHONIC NOTICE WAS GIVENTO THE NRC ON SEPTEMBER 10, 1993, BECAUSE IT WASN'T UNTIL THEN THAT IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE COST OF INVESTIGATION AND REPAIR COULD EXCEED $50,000."

THIS EXTREME WEATHER CONDITION CREATED AND EXCESS DEMAND AND REDUCED PRESSURES ON THE FAR END OF WASHINGTON GAS TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. WHEN PRESSURES ON BOWIE'S DISTRIBUTION REGULATOR SYSTEM REACHED A LOW OPERATING LEVEL ON THE MORNING OF JANUARY 19, 1994, SELECTED SECTIONS WERE SHUT OFF (APPROXIMATELY 1,700 METERS) IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE PRESSURE LOSS TO ANOTHER 10,000 METERS THAT COULD HAVE POSSIBLY BEEN AFFECTED. THIS WAS DONE AT THE EXTREME END OF THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM AND SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO ALL OUTAGES AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A PRESSURE INCREASE ON THE TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. ADDITIONALLY, 577 METERS WERE VALVED OFF IN WALDORF, MARYLAND, SOME 15 MILES SOUTH OF BOWIE. AT THE TIME OF TELEPHONIC REPORTING, THE CAUSE FOR THIS PRESSURE PROBLEM WAS UNKNOWN.

A500 PSI MAOP WAS TO BE ESTABLISHED WITH A TEST PRESSURE OF 750 PSI. IN ORDERTO OBTAIN THE 750 PSI TEST PRESSURE, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TEST PRESSUREAND THE ESTABLISHED MAOP OF 220 PSI WAS DIVIDED INTO FOURTHS GIVING 175 PSITEST PRESSURE SEGMENTS. THE FIRST STAGE OF THE TEST WAS TO PRESSURIZE THELINE TO THE ESTABLISHED MAOP OF 220 PSI. THIS PRESSURE WAS MAINTAINED FORAPPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES WHILE THIS SECTION OF PIPELINE, APPROXIMATELY 4026FEET, WAS BEING WALKED. THE SECOND STAGE OF THE TEST WAS TO PRESSURIZE THELINE TO 395 PSI AND MAINTAIN THIS PRESSURE WHILE THE LINE WAS BEING WALKED.THE THIRD STAGE REQUIRED PRESSURIZING THE PIPELINE TO 570 PSI. THIS TESTPRESSURE WAS ALSO MAINTAINED FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES WHILE THE LINE WASBEING WALKED. THE FOURTH, AND FINAL STAGE OF THE TEST, REQUIRED THAT THEPIPELINE BE PRESSURIZED TO 750 PSI. UPON ACHIEVING A TEST PRESSURE OFAPPROXIMATLEY 700 PSI, THE PIPELINE RUPTURED IN A CREEK CROSSING. AS ARESULT OF THIS RUPTURE, TWO INDIVIDUALS, WHICH ARE NON-EMPLOYEES, WERETRANSPORTED TO THE HOSPITAL, ONE OF WHICH WAS TREATED FOR HIGH HEART RATE ANDTHEN RELEASED APPROXIMATELY 3 HOURS LATER. THE SECOND INDIVIDUAL SUSTAINED ACONCUSSION AND WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR TWO DAYS. ALSO, AS A RESULT OF THISRUPTURE, 5 HOUSE TRAILERS, APPROXIMATELY 6 AUTOMOBILES AND 2 CAMPERS RECEIVEDDAMAGE.

THE FAILURE OCCURRED ON NORTHWEST PIPELINE CORPORATION'S 26 INCH IGNACIO, COLORADO TO SUMAS, WASHINGTON MAINLINE.IN THE ACCIDENT AREA THE LINE IS PARALLELED BY NORTHWEST'S 30 INCH LOOPLINE AND A 14 INCH PRODUCTS LINE OWNED BY OLYMPIC PIPELINE COMPANY. NORTHWEST'S 26INCH PIPE RUPTURED OR BUILDING DAMAGE. NEITHER OF THE ADJACENT LINES WERE DAMAGED REPAIRS WERE COMPLETE BY REPLACEMENT OF 201 FEET OF 26 INCH PIPE AND THE LINE WAS PURGED ON SATURDAY MARCH, 11, 1995. THE LINE WAS NOT RETURNED TO FULL SERVICE UNTIL MARCH 15, 1995 PENDING GEOTECHNICAL ASSESSMENTS OF THE SLIDE AREA AND EXCAVATION OF THE 26 AND 30 INCH LINES TO RELIEVE STRESSES. NATURAL GAS SERVICE WAS INTERRUPTED TO TWO INDUSTRIAL USERS FOR 3 HOURS AT ONE LOCATION AND 5 HOURS AT THE OTHER. GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING ASSESEMENT OF THE SITE AREA CONCLUDES THAT THE PIPELINES WERE IMPACTED BY A RECENT LANDSLIDE THAT EXTENDS APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET UPSLOPE FROM THE PIPELINES. PRELIM8INARY REPORTS OF LABORATORY ANALYSIS OF SELECTED SAMPLES OF THE FAILED PIPE INDICATE THE FAILURE WAS DUE TO RADICAL MOVEMENT OF THE BURIED LINE INDUCING A BUCKLE. THE BUCKLING AND THE STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MOVEMENT CAUSED THE PIPE TO RUPTURE AT THE BUCKLE. APPROXIMATELY 495 FEET OF 26 INCH LINE AND 268 FEET OF 30 INCH LINE WAS EXCAVATED AND LEFT FREE TO ENABLE FREE MOVEMENT OF THE LANDSLIDE. SUBSEQUENT INSPECTIONS OF THE TWO LINES CONFIRMED THAT THEIR SERVICEABILITY IS NOT IMPAIRED. THE SITE IS SECURED AND THE PIPELINES ARE OBSERVED DAILY. SURFACE DISPLACEMENT MEASUREMENTS ARE BEING TAKEN THREE TIMES PER WEEK AT THIS TIME. PLANS FOR LONG TERM REMEDIATION OF THE SITE WILL BE DEPENDENT ON CONTINUED EVALUATION OF THE CHARACTER AND EXTENT OF THE LANDSLIDE.CONTRACTOR WAS REMOVING PIPELINES IN AREA OF CHEV.

THE RELIEF VALVE IS INSTALLED TO PROVIDE OVERPRESSURE PROTECTION ON TWO SECTIONS OF THE 26-INCH LINE THAT HAVE AN MAOP OF 674 PSIG. THESE TWO SECTION ARE LOCATED FROM MILE 110.35 TO 111.74 AND MILO 113.52 TO 113.90 ON TEXAS GAS MAINLINE SYSTEM. PIPE MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS IN THESE SECTIONS ARE A.O. SMITH, 26"" O.D.

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF EVENTS THAT RESULTED IN ACTIVATION OF THE RELIEF VALVE. 4:00 PM-TEXAS GAS PERSONNEL AT CLARKSDALE COMPRESSOR STATION (MILE 171) REPORTED TO GAS CONTROL IN OWENSBORO, KENTUCKY THAT THE STATION'S GENERAL ELECTRIC TURBINE HAD SHUT DOWN. 5:00 PM SINCE THEY WERE UNABLE TO RESTART THE TURBINE AS ANTICIPATED, PERSONNEL AT CLARKSDALE STATION NOTIFIED GAS CONTROL OF THAT FACT AND INFORMED GAS CONTROL THAT ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL WERE ENROUTE TO ASSIST. GAS CONTROL RELAYED THIS INFORMATION TO PERSONNEL AT GREENVILLE AND LAKE CORMORANT STATIONS AND ADVISED TO ADJUST OPERATING CONDITITONS ACCORDINGLY. 5:47 PM GAS CONTROL RECEIVED A HIGH PRESSURE ALARM OF 675 PSIG INDICATING THAT THE 674 PSIG MAOP ON TWO SECTIONS OF THE 26-INCH, NO.1 LINE HAD BEEN EXCEEDED. 8:05 PM. ALTHOUGH ENCOUNTERING UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS, CLARKSDALE PERSONNEL CONTINUED IN THEIR EFFORTS TO RESTART THE GENERAL ELECTRIC TURBINE WHILE ADDITIONAL CLARKSDALE PERSONNEL WERE WORKING TO BRING A PRATT & WHITNEY TURBINE ON LINE. 8:26 PM GAS CONTROL RECEIVED AN ALARM INDICATING THAT THE RELIEF VALVE AT MILE 104.3 HAD OPENED. A TEXAS GAS EMPLOYEE WAS SENT TO THE RELIEF VALVE SITE. 9:20 PM CLARKSDALE PERSONNEL REPORTED TO GAS CONTROL THAT THE PRATT & WHITNEY TURBINE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY STARTED. 9:55 PM GAS CONTROL NOTIFIED BY THE FIELD THAT THE RELIEF VALVE AT MILE 104.3 WAS CLOSED. 1O:45 PM GAS CONTROL RECEIVED SYSTEM NOTIFICATION THAT PRESSURE ON THE 26-INCH, NO.1 LINE HAD FALLEN BELOW THE MAOP OF 674 PSIG.

THE RELOCATION PROJECT WAS NEARLY COMPLETE EXCEPT FOR THE TIE-INS TO THE EXISTING LINE AT EACH END. AT 7:00 AM AN EIGHT INCH VALVE (VALVE #14) WAS CLOSED ON THE NORTH END AND AT 9:30 AM TWO MAINLINE EIGHT INCH VALVES WERE SHUT TO ALLOW TIE-IN AT THE SOUTH END. THE VALVES WERE GREASED TO STOP ANY LEAKAGE AND THE LINE WAS BLOWN DOWN. THE NORTH TIE-IN WAS TO BE LOCATED WITHIN THIRTY FEET OF A VALVE BOX WHICH HOUSED VALVE #14. LINE PRESSURE WAS APPROXIMATELY 548 PSIG UPSTREAM OF VALVE #14 AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. THE VALVE BOX ALSO CONTAINED A THREE INCH PIPELINE TAKEOFFWHICH SUPPLIES GAS TO THE TOWN OF POPLAR, MONTANA, APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN MILES NORTHEAST. TIE-IN WORK PROCEEDED WITH A CREW AT EACH END OF THE RELOCATION. THE CREW ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE RIVER PROCEEDED WITH THE TIE-IN BY MAKINGTWO CIRCUMFERENTIAL CUTS APPROXIMATELY 4-5 INCVHES APART. THE WELDER THEN PROCEEDED DOWN THE PIPELINE APPROXIMATELY 15-18 FEET AND MADE ANOTHER CUT. THE WELDER THEN RETURNED TO THE ORIGINAL CUTS AND WITH A HAND TORCH STARTED CUTTING THE SMALL SEGMENT INTO THREE PIECES. THE TWO SEGMENTS ON TOP OF THE PIPE WERE KNOCKED OUT FIRST. AT APPROXIMATELY 10:15 AM WHEN THE BOTTOM SEGMENT WAS KNOCKED OUT THE TWO OPEN ENDS OF THE PIPELINE SLAMMED TOGETHER. THE CREW IMMEDIATELY REALIZED THAT SOMETHING HAD PARTED UPSTREAM AND THERE WAS A LOUD ROARFROM GAS BEING RELEASED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE VALVE BOX. THE CREW EVACUATED THE AREA IMMEDIATELY. THE GAS IGNITED WITHIN SECONDS OF THE RELEASE CONSUMING THE VALVE BOX AND ASSOCIATED PIPELINE EQUIPMENT THAT WAS PARKED ADJACENT TO THE WORK AREA.

ANOTHER CREW ALSO SHUTIN THE THREE INCH PIPELINE THAT RUNS TO POPLAR MONTANA AT THE CLOSEST MAINLINE VALVE APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES AWAY. AT 10:35 AM THE PIPELINE WAS SHUTIN AND WAS BLOWING DOWN. AT 10:45 AM LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICALS ARRIVED AND STARTED CONTROLLING TRAFFIC SINCE THIS LOCATION IS APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET FROM MONTANA HIGHWAY 13. THE LOCAL FIRE DEPARTMENT ARRIVED AT 10:45 AM AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO STANDBY UNTIL THE PIPELINE HAD BLOWN DOWN. AT 11:00 AM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT PUT OUT SOME GRASS FIRES AND AT 11:15 AM THE FIRE DEPARTMENT EXTINGUISHED THE FIRES ASSSOCIATED WITH PIPELINE EQUIPMENT AND THE VALVE BOX. AT APPROXIMATELY 11:50 AM COMPANY PERSONAL BEGAN SURVYING THE AREA AND DISCOVERED A CRATER ABOUT FIFTEEN FEET INDIAMETER AND SIX FEET DEEP WITH A SHORT STYLE 38 DRESSER COUPLING PARTED FROM THE PIPELINE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER. THE LOCATION WHERE THE COUPLING PARTED WAS APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN FEET UPSTREAM FROM THE VALVE BOX THAT HOUSEDTHE POPLAR TAKEOFF AND VALVE #14.THE NORTH CREW CONSISTED OF SEVEN COMPANY EMPLOYEES. ONLY ONE MINOR PERSONAL INJURY WAS REPORTED AS A RESULT OF THIS INCIDENT WHICH CONSISTED OF A JAMMED FINGER RECEIVED WHILE AN EMPLOYEE WAS EVACUATING THE SCENE. AT 5:10 PM TEMPORARY REPAIRS WERE MADE, WELDS WERE X-RAYED AND PURGING BEGAN. THE LINE WAS PRESSURED TO 120 PSIG AND HELD THERE UNTIL A LEAK SURVEY WAS COMPLETED ON APPROXIMATELY 800 FEET OF PIPELINE UPSTREAM OF THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT. NO PROBLEMS WERE FOUND AND AT THIS POINT ALL VALVES WERE OPENED AND THE PIPELINE WAS RETURNED TO NORMAL SERVICE. THE ONLY INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FARMTAP CUSTOMERS ALONG THE RIGHT-OF-WAY. DAMAGES WERE SIGNIFICANT DUE TO THE GAS IGNITING, PROBABLY DUE TO STATICELECTRICITY OF FLYING DEBRIS CREATING A SPARK, AND THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF PARKED COMPANY EQUIPMENT. DAMAGES AMOUNTED TO $184,000 WITH THE MAJORITY OF EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FIRE DAMAGE TO TWO WELDING TRUCKS, A BACKHOE/LOADER, A TRUCK MOUNTED CRANE, AND A PICKUP."

IT IS BELIEVED THAT ONE OR TWO PREVIOUSSPHERES WERE ALREADY SETTING IN THE TEE.  THE DOWNSTREAM DELIVERY PRESSURE TOEXXON DROPPED RAPIDLY AND DELIVERIES TO EXXON AND THE PIPELINE DISCHARGEFACILITY (PDF) WERE STOPPED.  THE SPHERES WERE BELIEVED TO BE STUCK DUE TOHYDRATE FORMATION AT THE DOWNSTREAM END OF THE RADIAL FLOW TEE.  SINCE THEREWAS NO METHANOL READILY AVAILABLE AND NO PLACE TO INJECT METHANOL NEAR THERADIAL FLOW TEE, THE OPERATOR DECIDED TO USE DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE TO TRY TOFREE THE STUCK SPHERES.  A VALVE ON THE UPSTREAM SIDE OF THE RECEIVER WASCLOSED AND THE PRESSURE ON THE RECEIVER WAS REDUCED TO CREATE A DIFFERENTIALPRESSURE TO MOVE THE SPHERE.  WHEN THE VALVE WAS OPENED, ONE OR TWO SPHERESDISLODGED, MOVED RAPIDLY INTO THE RECEIVER AND CREATED A PRESSURE SURGE ON THESCRAPER TRAP PIPING AND APPURTENANCES.  A 3/4"" X 1/2"" SWAGE FITTING, WHICH WASLOCATED BETWEEN THE TOP OF THE RECEIVER LEVEL INDICATOR AND THE 1/2""PLUGGED BLOWDOWN VALVE, FAILED AT THE TOP OF THE 3/4"" THREADS ALLOWING A SMALLAMOUNT OF CONDENSATE TO BE BLOWN INTO THE AIR AS A MIST THAT MOVED IN ANORTHERNLY DIRECTION AND COATED SOME PIPING, GRAVEL AND CANE STUBBLE.  AS THEPIPING WAS BEING SHUT IN AND SECURED, IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE MOTOR- OPERATEDVALVE ACTUATOR ON ONE OF THE TWO 30"" BLOCK VALVE TO THE RECEIVER WASHYDROSTATICALLY TESTED FOR ONE HOUR PRIOR TO RETURNING TO SERVICE.  ANEMERGENCY RESPONSE CONTRACTOR WAS CALLED OUT TO CLEAN UP THE CONDENSATERESIDUE USING ABSORBANT PADS.ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKENINCLUDE: INSTALLATION OF METHANOL INJECTION PORTS NEAR BOTH THE UPSTREAM ANDDOWNSTREAM ENDS OF THE RADIAL FLOW TEE; A GUIDELINE FOR HANDLING SITUATIONSWHERE SPHERES BECOME STUCK IN RADIAL FLOW TEES AS PREPARED, IMPLEMENTED ANDREVIEWED WITH STATION OPERATIONS PERSONNEL; AND, ACCURACY OF THE WATERMONITORING INSTUMENTS WAS CHECKED AND VERIFIED.  PRESSURE SAFETY SWITCHESWILL BE INSTALLED TO PROHIBIT THE VALVE FROM ACTUATING WHEN A SPECIFIEDPRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL IS EXCEEDED.  ALSO, A SAFETY REVIEW TRAINING SESSION ISPLANNED WITH OPERATIONS PERSONNEL CONCERNING POTENTIAL ENERGY HAZARDSASSOCIATED WITH A HIGH PRESSURE GAS FACILITY."

THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILES WEST OF THE CITY OF JACKSON, TENNESSEE.  THE FAILURE OCCURRED IN THE CENTER OF CUB CREEK AT LINE MILEPOST 33+2612, WHICH IS 5.22 MILES FROM THE TERMINUS OF THE 8""LINE.  SERVICE WAS INTERRUPTED TO TWO OF WGP-TEXAS GASS DELIVERY POINTS.  FROM CONVERSATIONS WITH THE LOCAL DISTRIBUTION COMPANY, WE UNDERSTAND 628 LDC CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING 6 OR 8 INDUSTRIAL USERS, LOST GAS SERVICE.  FULL GAS SERVICE WAS RESTORED TO THE WGP-TEXAS GAS DELIVERY POINTS BY 7:32AM CST, ON OCTOBER 30, 1998.  AN ONGOING METALLURICAL INVESTIGATION HAS CONCLUDED THE FOLLOWING.  THE FAILURE INITIATED IN A SEGMENT OF PIPE CONTAINING A DENT AND GOUGES CREATED BY OUTSIDE FORCES.  THE DENT AND GOUGE DAMAGE, PRESUMABLY CAUSED BY EXCAVATING EQUIPMENT, EXTENDED 111"" IN LENGTH ALONG THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS OF THE 8"" PIPE.  THE FAILURE RESULTED IN A 25"" LENGTH OF PIPE BEING SEPARATED FROM THE CONTIGUOUS PIPELINE SYSTEM.  THE LINE PIPE WAS CATHODICALLY PROTECTED.  MINERAL DEPOSITS STRONGLY SUGGEST A LONG-TERM, UNDERGROUND EXPOSURE AFTER THE OUTSIDE-FORCE DAMAGE OCCURRED.  THE METALLURGICAL EVALUATION HAS RULED OUT ANY INVOLVEMENT OF THE LONGITUDINAL OR GIRTH WELD SEAMS.  PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS CONFINED TO TEXAS GAS FACILITIES.  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN A CREEK BED LOCATED IN AN AGRICULTURAL AREA BEING UTLIZED AS PASTURE GROUND.   PERMANENT REPAIRS TO THE PIPELINE, INCLUDING CLEANUP AND BANK RESTORATION WERE COMPLETED ON NOVEMBER 6, 1998.

THREE OGT EMPLOYEES, BOBO RENEGAR, LINDSEY SOUTHWARD, ANDJOHN FRYAR,  WERE PIGGING A SECTION OF A-1300 20"" FROM MAYSVILLE JUNCTION TOPURCELL JUNCTION.  THEY ARRIVED AT PURCELL JUNCTION AND PULLED THE 20"" FROMCUP PIG, AN ENDURO ADV-3CC-BL (36"" O.A.L.), INTO THE RECEIVER, TRIPPING THEPIG SIGNAL (3) AT ABOUT 1:20PM CST.  THE A-1300 SIDE VALVE (1) WAS OPENED, ANDTHE 20""RECEIVER VALVE (2) WAS CLOSED.  THE 8"" KICKER GAS VALVE (6) WAS ALSOCLOSED.  BLOWOFF VALVE (4) WAS OPEN ONE-HALF WAY, AND BLOWOFF VALVE (5) WASOPENED COMPLETELY.  THE RECEIVER CLOSURE (7) WAS OPENED AND MOVED TO ONESIDE.  AFTER FIVE MINUTES LINDSAY SOUTHWARD LOOKED INTO THE RECEIVER BARRELFROM A DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 12 FEET DIRECTLY AWAY AND 6 FEET TO THE SIDEOF THE RECEIVER CLOSURE.  HE NOTED THAT THE PIG WAS VISIBLE IN THE TRAP.  WEESTIMATE THE DISTANCE FROM THE RECEIVER CLOSURE THREADS TO THE PIG NOSE TO BE3-4 FEET.  BOB RENEGAR LOOKED INTO THE RECEIVER BARREL FROM THE IMMEDIATE EDGEOF THE CLOSURE OPENING, AND PUT HIS HEAD DOWN TO INSPECT THE AMOUNT OF SLUDGE,ETC., THAT THE PIG HAD MOVED.  BOB MADE A COMMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF FLUIDS THATHAD BEEN MOVED.  BOB MADE A COMMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF FLUIDS THAT HAD BEENMOVED, AND AT THAT TIME THE PIF SHOT OUT OF THE END OF THE RECEIVER HITTINGTHE GROUND AT APPROXIMATELY 23 FEET AND ROLLING TO A STOP AT 57 FEET FROM THERECEIVER.  LINDSEY SOUTHWARD DESCRIBED THE NOISE THAT OCCURRED AS A DEEP CORKPOPPING SOUND.  BOB RENEGAR FELL ON HIS BACK, HIT ABOVE THE RIGHT EYE BY THEPIG AND BLEEDING SEVERELY.  NEITHER LINDSEY SOUTHWARD OR JOHN FRYAR WERESTANDING IN A POSITION TO BE STRUCK BY THE PIG, AND WERE INJURED.  LINDSEYSOUTHWARD AND JOHN FRYAR PROVIDED ASSISTANCE TO BOB RENEGAR UNTIL MEDICALPERSONNEL ARRIVED, AND TRAVELED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH HIM, WHERE HE WASADMITTED FOR TREATMENT OF SEVERE HEAD INJURIES WHICH ULTIMATELY REQUIREDCORRECTIVE SURGERY.  SCOTT HARDY, AN EMPLOYEE OF ONEOK, INC. ARRIVED AT THESITE TO SECURE THE SITE BY CLOSING THE RECEIVER CLOSURE (7) AND CLOSINGBLOWOFF (4) AND (5). FOLLOWING THE ACCIDENT, OGT HAS PERFORMED ANINVESTIGATION TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT.

ALSO,REPRESENTATIVES FROM NORSTROM VALVES, INC AND MYLON C. JACOBS SUPPLY HAVEINSPECTED THE 20"" RECEIVER VALVE (2).  THE INITIAL REPORT FROM NORSTROMINDICATES THAT THE RECEIVER VALVE (2) DOES HAVE MINIMAL LEAKAGE, BUT ISOPERATING PROPERLY AND EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS GAS FLOW FROM THE PURPOSES OFPIGGING OUR PIPELINES.  FURTHER, THE BLOWOFF VALVE (4) WAS STILL COMPLETELYOPEN AND WOULD HAVE VENTED ANY GAS THAT HAD LEAKED PAST THE RECEIVER VALVE (2)IS OPERATING PROPERLY.

THE RUPTURE WAS CAUSED BY EXTERNAL CORROSION WHICHHAD TAKEN PLACE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPELINE.  THE MOST SEVERELY CORRODEDAREA, WHICH CORRESPONDS TO ORIGIN OF THE RUPTURE, WAS ONLY ABOUT 13 INCHES INLENGTH.  OTHER THINNED AREAS, NOT AS SEVERELY AFFECTED, WERE FOUND OVER ABOUTA 6-FOOT LONG REGION ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE.  MEASUREMENTS OF THEREMAINING WALL THICKNESS WITHIN THE ORIGIN REGION PRODUCED VALVES IN SOMELOCATIONS AS SMALL AS 0.087 RO 0.099 INCH.  MY RSTRENG CALCULATION BASED ONTHE MEASUREMENTS OVER THE 13-INCH ORIGIN REGION INDICATED A BURST PRESSURE OF876 PSIG.  THIS AGREES REASONABLY WELL WITH THE PRESSURE LEVEL AT THE TIME OFTHE INCIDENT 917 PSIG (STATED BY CNG PERSONNEL AT THE RUPTURE SITE).  A ROUGH,PRELIMINARY MAP OF REMAINING WALL THICKNESS CONTOURS IS ATTACHED AS IS ADIAGRAM OF THE OVERALL RUPTURE.  ABOUT 33.7 FEET OF PIPE INVOLVING TWO JOINTSWERE AFFECTED."

OPERATING PRESSURE AT THE TIME OF FAILURE WAS740 PSIG AND THE GAS FLOW RATE AT THE TIME OF FAILURE WAS REPORTED TO BE 10MMCF.  SYSTEM DESIGN PRESSURE IS 1348 PSIG.  ON SITE INVESTIGATION, BY BOTHTRANSOK AND MICROALLOYING PERSONNEL, REVEALED THAT IN EXCESS OF 20 FEET OF THEPIPELINE WAS TORN FROM THE ORIGINAL INSTALLATION.  THE ACTUAL DEBRIS CONSISTEDON ONE SECTION OF PIPE WHICH UNRAVELED IN A SPIRAL PATTERN AS SHOWN INF FIGURE1.  THE PRELIMINARY ON SITE INVESTIGATION SHOWED THAT THE RUPTURE MOST LIKELYINITIATED AT THE LOWEST POINT OF THE INSTALLATION WHERE CONDENSATION ANDMOISTURE WOULD BE EXPECTED TO COLLECT.  THIS REGION IS SHOWN IN FIGURE 2 WHICHALSO SHOWS THAT SEVERE LOCALIZED CORROSION IS ALIGNED AT THE BOTTOM (SIXO'CLOCK INSTALLED POSITION) OF THE PIPE.  THE LOCALIZED CORROSION EXTENDEDAPPROXIMATELY 18 INCHES ALONG THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE AND WAS SEVERAL INCHESACROSS AT THE WIDEST SECTION.  THE ERW WELD ON THIS PARTICULAR SEGMENT WASALIGNED NEAR THE ELEVEN O'CLOCK IN THE INSTALLED POSITION.  THE SPIRAL TEAREXHIBITED A DUCTILE FRACTURE SURFACE WITH LOCALIZED DISTORTION NEAR THEFRACTURE SURFACE AND A 45 DEGREE SHEAR SEPARATION ANGLE ALONG THE LENGTH OFTHE TEAR.  THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF CORROSION ALONG THE SPIRAL TEAR.

THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT WAS MILEPOST 346+5181, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 2.75 MILES NORTHEAST OF THE CITY OF KENTON, TENNESSEE, AND APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE DOWNSTREAM OF TEXAS GAS KENTON, TN, COMPRESSOR STATION.  THERE WERE NO INJURIES OR FATALITIES RESULTING FROM THIS INCIDENT.  THERE WERE NO SERVICE INTERUPTIONS AS A RESULT OF THE FAILURE.  TEXAS GAS STAFF METALLURGIST HAS DETERMINED THE FAILURE WAS INITIATED BY A STRESS CORROSION CRACK THAT EXTENDED 5 5/8"" ALONG THE LONGITUDINAL AXIS OF THE PIPE.  THE FAILURE RESULTED IN A 29-FOOT LENGTH OF PIPE BEING SEPARATED FROM THE CONTIGOUS PIPELINE SYSTEM.  THE PIPELINE SYSTEM HAS BEEN UNDER CATHODIC PROTECTION SINCE ITS CONSTRUCTION IN 1952.  THE LINE HAD BEEN HYDROSTATICALLY TESTED IN 1964 AND 1985.  PROPERTY DAMAGE WAS CONFINED TO TEXAS GAS FACILITIES.  THE INCIDENT OCCURRED IN A FIELD DEDICATED TO CROP FARMING WHERE THERE WERE NO DWELLINGS WITHIN THE PIPELINE CORRIDOR.  ESTIMATED COST OF REPAIR AND GAS LOSS ARE DEFINED AS FOLLOWS: GAS LOSS: $305,000, MATERIAL $4,000, LABOR $3,000, EQUIPMENT $750, X-RAY $600, TOTAL COST OF DAMAGE AND REPAIR - 312,750.  AFTER THE IN-SERVICE FAILURE DESCRIBED ABOVE, COMPANY PERSONNEL HYDROSTATICALLY RETESTED TWO BLOCK VALVE SECTIONS (APPROX. 20 MILES) OF THE LINE PIPE DOWNSTREAM OF THE KENTON COMPRESSOR STATION.  ONE TEST FAILURE OCCURRED WHICH WAS ATTRIBUTED TO STRESS CORROSION CRACKING.  THE ENTIRE 20-MILE SEGMENT WAS SUCCESSFULLY RETESTED TO 100% SPECIFIED MINIMUM YIELD STRENGTH BY OCTOBER 18, 1999.  PERMANENT REPAIRS AT THE SITE OF THE SERVICE FAILURE CONSISTED OF REPLACEMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 80 OF LINE PIPE.  POST-TEST CLEAN-UP ACTIVITIES ARE UNDERWAY.

AFTER A CLOSER INSPECTION OF UNIT, LEVELS, AND ALARMS, HE DETERMINED THE BURNER TUBE WAS NOT OPERATING. AT APPROXIMATELY 8:50 A.M., HE RESTARTED THE UNIT BY RE-IGNITING THE BURNER TUBE AND THEN PROCEEDED WITH HIS ROUNDS. APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES LATER HE HEARD A GURGLING NOISE FROM THE DEHYDRATOR AND SAW LIQUID BEING RELEASED FROM THE 2"" VENT. AT THAT INSTANT, THE LIQUID/VAPOR IGNITED AND BEGAN TO BURN. THE FEILD OPERATOR IMMEDIATELY SHUT DOWN THE UNIT. AFTER SEVERAL MINUTES, THE LIQUID AND VAPOR RELEASE FROM THE 2"" VENT STOPPED.

ANOTHER OPERATOR HAD ARRIVED TO ASSIST AND TOGETHER THEY EXTINGUISHED THE RESIDUAL FIRE USING TWO 30# PORTABLE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. THE YUKON FIRE DEPARTMENT WAS CALLED AND ARRIVED AT APPROXIMATELY 9:20 A.M. THE FIRE DEPARTMENT APPLIED WATER TO THE DEHYDRATOR UNIT TO ASSIST COOLING AND PREVENT RE-IGNITION. NO INJURIES OCCURRED. DAMAGE COST IS ESTIMATED AT $15,000. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION REVEALED THE FLAME IN THE BURNER TUBE WAS SOMEHOW EXTINGUISHED AND THE FLAME SENSOR FAILED TO DETECT IT. THE SENSOR IS CONFIGURED TO SHUT DOWN THE UNIT IN THE EVENT OF A ""FLAME OUT"" AND SIGNAL AN OPERATIONAL UPSET ALARM.

WITH THE BURNER TUBE NOT HEATING THE GLYCOL, IT COOLED TO THE POINT WHERE NATURAL GAS CONDENSATE WAS NOT SEPARATING FROM THE GLYCOL IN THE CONTACT TOWER. NATURAL GAS CONDENSATE THEN BEGAN TO ENTER THE DEHYDRATOR UNIT WITH THE GLYCOL. THE CONDENSATE ACCUMULATED ON TOP OF THE GLYCOL DUE TO ITS LOWER SPECIFIC GRAVITY. WHEN THE OPERATOR RE-STARTED BURNER TUBE IT HEATED THE GLYCOL/CONDENSATE MIXTURE CAUSING THE CONDENSATE TO RAPIDLY EVAPORATE INSIDE THE DEHYDRATOR UNTIL ENOUGH PRESSURE BUILT UP TO ""BURP"" LIQUID FROM THE 2"" VENT.

THE PIPE WS EVALUATED BY KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES, INC IN WORTHINGTON - OHIO.  THE FAILURE OCCURRED WHILE A READY-MIX TRUCK WAS UNLOADING CONCRETE FOR A CONCRETE SLAB.  THE REAR AXLES OF THE READY-MIX TRUCK WERE POSITIONED APPROXIMATELY ALMOST PARALLEL TO AND OVER THE PIPELINE.  THE LINE WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 300 PSIG AT THE TIME OF THE FAILURE. AN 8.2 FOOT SEGMENT OF FAILED PIPE WAS ANALYZED TO DETERMINE MATERIAL PROPERTIES, CHEMICAL PROPERTIES, AND TO CHARACTERIZE THE FRACTURE AREA.  TWO ADDITIONAL 1-FOOT SEGMENTS WERE REMOVED FROM THE PIPELINE ADJACENT TO THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE MATERIAL FOR MECHANICAL TESTING.  THE PIPE WAS 8.625 INCH OD, 0.203 INCH WT FURNACE LAP WELDED PIPE.  THE CONSLUSIONS FROM THE TESTING PROVIDED BY KIEFNER AND ASSOCIATES INC, STATED THAT THE LAP-WELD SEAM WAS NOT CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE OF THE IRON PIPE.  AN AREA OF MECHANICAL DAMAGE WAS LOCATED IN THE CENTER OF THE FRACTURE.  THE MECHANICAL DAMAGE WAS PRESENT PRIOR TO THE FRACTURE, AS INDICATED BY THE MATCHING SMEARED METAL PATTERN APPEARING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FRACTURE.  THE PREEXISTING MECHANICAL DAMAGE LOCATED AT THE CENTER OF THE PIPELINE FRACTURE IS CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE FAILURE.

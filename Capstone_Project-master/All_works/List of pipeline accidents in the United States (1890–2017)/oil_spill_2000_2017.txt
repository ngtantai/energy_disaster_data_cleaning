* On February 5, a pipeline failed and spilled over {{convert|192,000|USgal|L}} of crude oil in the [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge]] in Pennsylvania.

* On March 9, an Explorer petroleum products pipeline failed in [[Greenville, Texas]]. The 28-inch pipeline ruptured and released {{convert|13436|oilbbl|m3}} of gasoline. The released gasoline eventually reached East Caddo Creek. The banks of the tributary and creek contained the escaping gasoline as it flowed away from the ruptured pipe. The probable cause of the pipeline failure was corrosion-fatigue cracking that initiated at the edge of the longitudinal seam weld at a likely preexisting weld defect. Contributing to the failure was the loss of pipe coating integrity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0103.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Transportation Safety Board |date=March 9, 2000 |website=Ntsb.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203115859/http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0103.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2016 }}</ref>
* On April 7, a pipeline released fuel oil at Chalk Point near [[Aquasco, Maryland]]. The Piney Point Oil Pipeline system, which was owned by the Potomac Electric Power Company (Pepco), experienced a pipe failure at the [[Chalk Point Generating Station]] in southeastern [[Prince George's County, Maryland]]. The release was not discovered and addressed by the contract operating company, Support Terminal Services, Inc., until the late afternoon. Approximately {{convert|140,400|USgal|L}} of fuel oil were released into the surrounding wetlands and Swanson Creek and, subsequently, the [[Patuxent River]] as a result of the accident. No injuries were caused by the accident, which cost approximately $71&nbsp;million for environmental response and clean-up operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0201.aspx |title=Pipeline Accident Report PAR-02-01 |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date= |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922142532/http://ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0201.aspx |archivedate=September 22, 2015 }}</ref>
* On May 19, a [[Colonial Pipeline]] Co. line failed near [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. At least 714 gallons (17 barrels) of kerosene spilled, some of which entered a pond that flows into a tributary of the East Fork Deep River. The kerosene spill caused a sheen about 40 feet by 40 feet in the pond. As a result of this, and six other previous [[Colonial Pipeline]] accidents, the EPA fined Colonial $34&nbsp;million in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/cases/civil/cwa/colonial.html |title=Settlement: Colonial Pipeline Company Clean Water Act Settlement &#124; Civil Enforcement &#124; Compliance and Enforcement &#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=April 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028062657/http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/cases/civil/cwa/colonial.html |archivedate=October 28, 2013}}</ref>
* On June 7, a stopple fitting weld failed on a Wolverine Pipeline Company line, causing a rupture releasing {{convert|75,000|USgal|L}} of gasoline into the environment, and causing the evacuation of more than 500 houses in [[Blackman Charter Township, Michigan]]. The failure caused the shutdown of 30% of Michigan's gasoline supplies for nine days, contaminated a creek which flows into the Grand River, and a railroad track near the failure site was shut down for a week. Later tests found 715 anomalies in this pipeline. Wolverine later agreed to pay for switching houses in the area from local water wells to a city water source.<ref>{{cite web

* On August 19, a 30-inch diameter [[El Paso Natural Gas]] pipeline rupture and fire near [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]] killed 12 members of an extended family camping over {{convert|600|ft|m}} from the rupture point. The force of the escaping gas created a {{convert|51|ft|m|adj=on}}-wide crater about {{convert|113|ft|m}} along the pipe. A {{convert|49|ft|m|adj=on}} section of the pipe was ejected from the crater, in three pieces measuring approximately {{convert|3|ft|m}}, {{convert|20|ft|m}}, and {{convert|26|ft|m}} in length. The largest piece of pipe was found about {{convert|287|ft|m}} northwest of the crater. The cause of the failure was determined to be severe internal corrosion of that pipeline. On July 26, 2007, a USDOJ Consent Decree was later entered into by the pipeline owner to perform pipeline system upgrades to allow better internal pipeline inspections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0301.aspx |title=Pipeline Accident Report PAR-03-01 |publisher=Ntsb.gov |date=August 19, 2000 |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908011132/http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/PAR0301.aspx |archivedate=September 8, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/enrd/4431.htm |title=USDOJ: Environment and Natural Resources Division : U.S. v.

* On July 2, excavation damage to a natural gas distribution line resulted in an explosion and fire in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. A contractor hired by the city of Wilmington to replace sidewalk and curbing, dug into an unmarked natural gas service line with a backhoe. Although the service line did not leak where it was struck, the contact resulted in a break in the line inside the basement of a nearby building, where gas began to accumulate. A manager for the contractor said that he did not smell gas and therefore did not believe there was imminent danger and that he called an employee of the gas company and left a voice mail message. At approximately 1:44&nbsp;p.m., an explosion destroyed two residences and damaged two others to the extent that they had to be demolished. Other nearby residences sustained some damage, and the residents on the block were displaced from their houses for about a week. Three contractor employees sustained serious injuries. Eleven additional people sustained minor injuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0401.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Transportation Safety Board |date=July 2, 2003 |website=Ntsb.gov |accessdate=January 18, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203115859/http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAB0401.pdf |archivedate=February 3, 2016 }}</ref>

Oil was discovered in the water table in late 2000, and in March 2001 a group of Midland residents sued EOTT, TNMP and Equilon. Residents living on affected land also received settlements.

* On May 4, [[Kinder Morgan]]'s Florida Gas Transmission pipeline burst near Palm City and [[Hobe City, Florida|Hobe City]] (near [[Port Salerno, Florida]]). The explosion ejected 106 feet of buried pipe weighing about 5,000 pounds out of the ground and onto the right-of-way between Interstate 95 and the Florida Turnpike (SR-91). The rupture was near a high school that was within the 366-foot potential impact radius. Two people were injured when their car ran off the road, and a Sheriff's deputy walked through a dense cloud and inhaled natural gas. The escaping gas did not ignite. The leak caused $596,218 in property damage.

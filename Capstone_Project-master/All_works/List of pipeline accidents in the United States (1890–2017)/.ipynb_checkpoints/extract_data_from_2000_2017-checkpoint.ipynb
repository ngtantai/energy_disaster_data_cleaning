Two days before the rupture, an in-line inspection device was run through the pipe segment, with no anomalies in the rupture area reported. Contributing to the severity of the accident was [[Colonial Pipeline]] Company\\'s failure to determine from the SCADA system that a leak had occurred, with the result that the pipeline controller started and restarted the pipeline, increasing the amount of diesel fuel that was released.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2001/PAB0101.pdf|title=Safety Recommendations |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205090435/http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2001/PAB0101.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2010 }}</ref>',\n",

This resulted in two leaks in the natural gas service line, which was operated at 35 psig. One leak occurred where the backhoe bucket had contacted and pulled the natural gas service line. The other was a physical separation of the gas service line at an underground joint near the meter, which was close to the building. Gas migrated into a building nearby, where it ignited. An explosion followed, destroying three buildings. Other buildings within a two-block area of the explosion sustained significant damage. Three fatalities, five serious injuries, and one minor injury resulted from this accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2000/PAB0001.htm |title=Pipeline Report|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225084216/http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2000/PAB0001.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref>\\n* 1999 On January 23, a construction crew ruptured a 10-inch diameter petroleum products pipe near [[Germantown, Wisconsin]], spilling about 41,000 gallons of gasoline.<ref name=\"phmsa.dot.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/portal/site/PHMSA/menuitem.ebdc7a8a7e39f2e55cf2031050248a0c/?vgnextoid=fdd2dfa122a1d110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&vgnextchannel=3430fb649a2dc110VgnVCM1000009ed07898RCRD&vgnextfmt=print|title=PHMSA - Data & Statistics  - Distribution, Transmission & Gathering, LNG, and Liquid Accident and Incident Data|work=dot.gov|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042351/http://primis.phmsa.dot.gov/comm/reports/enforce/documents/320125016H/320125016H_Corrective+Action+Order_07202012.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=4 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref>\\n* 1999 A pipeline ruptured in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and released over {{convert|53,000|USgal|L}} of diesel fuel into the Tennessee River on February 9.

       " '1986 Early on July 8, a [[Williams Companies]] petroleum products pipeline ruptured in [[Mounds View, Minnesota]]. Gasoline at 1,434 psi sprayed a residential area around 4:20&nbsp;am local time, then ignited. A woman and her 7-year-old daughter suffered fatal burns, at least two others were injured, and many homes damaged or destroyed. Confusion by the pipeline company led to a delay in shutting down the pipeline. Electrical resistance welded ([[Electric resistance welding|ERW]]) seam failure caused the rupture. Prior to this accident, this pipeline, installed in 1957, had 16 seam failures during hydrostatic testing, and 7 seam failures during operations until 1984. In 1984, 16 more seams failed during a hydrostatic test. Problems with cathodic protection were also noted before the 1986 accident. During a hydrostatic test of this pipeline following the accident, 3 ERW seams failed. Studies of available data by OPS staff in early 1988 showed that ERW seams have been involved in 145 service failures in both hazardous liquid and natural gas pipelines since 1970 to early 1988, and that of these failures, all but 2 occurred on pipe manufactured prior to 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/PAR8702.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Transportation Safety Board : Pipeline Accident Report |date=July 8, 1986 |website=Ntsb.gov |accessdate=2016-01-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/12564991.html |title=July 9, 1986: Gasoline pipeline explodes in Mounds View|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427142920/http://www.startribune.com/local/12564991.html |archivedate=April 27, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Files/Advisory%20Bulletin%20Files/xALN-88-01.pdf |format=PDF |title=Alert Notice : Recent findings relative to factors contributing to operational failures of pipelines constructed with ERW prior to 1970. |website=Phmsa.dot.gov |accessdate=2016-01-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/templates/Print_This_Story?sid=12564991|title=July 9, 1986: Gasoline pipeline explodes in Mounds View|work=startribune.com|accessdate=18 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"mycommittees.api.org\">{{cite web|url=http://mycommittees.api.org/standards/ecs/sc5/Technical%20Papers/electricresistanceweldfailures.pdf |format=PDF |title=Electric Resistance Weld Pipe Failures on Hazardous Liquid and Gas Transmission Pipelines |website=Mycommittees.api.org |accessdate=2016-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094851/http://mycommittees.api.org/standards/ecs/sc5/Technical%20Papers/electricresistanceweldfailures.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}</ref>\\n',\n",

The other was a physical separation of the gas service line at an underground joint near the meter, which was close to the building. Gas migrated into a building nearby, where it ignited. An explosion followed, destroying three buildings. Other buildings within a two-block area of the explosion sustained significant damage. Three fatalities, five serious injuries, and one minor injury resulted from this accident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2000/PAB0001.htm |title=Pipeline Report|accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225084216/http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2000/PAB0001.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2011 }}</ref>\\n',\n",

A brittle-like crack was found on the pipe in an area of coating failure. The NTSB expressed concern that the material\\'s toughness had a role in this rupture. Two days before the rupture, an in-line inspection device was run through the pipe segment, with no anomalies in the rupture area reported. Contributing to the severity of the accident was [[Colonial Pipeline]] Company\\'s failure to determine from the SCADA system that a leak had occurred, with the result that the pipeline controller started and restarted the pipeline, increasing the amount of diesel fuel that was released.<ref name=\"epa.gov\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2001/PAB0101.pdf|title=Safety Recommendations |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205090435/http://www.ntsb.gov/publictn/2001/PAB0101.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2010 }}</ref>\\n',\n",
